# Students
One of the best parts of being a prof is working with talented and passionate graduate and undergraduate students. I am the administrative supervisor of the students listed below, but my philosophy is to work less hierarchically (e.g., there is no "Ernst lab") and more in a networked fashion. I therefore collaborate with my own students, but also with other students, with other groups and faculty (like [CHISEL](https://thechiselgroup.org) and [SEGAL](https://http://thesegalgroup.org)), and industry. 

Prospective students [see here](/prospective/).

Current students should read through the [onboarding](https://github.com/neilernst/Onboarding) documents.
