# Students
One of the best parts of being a prof is working with talented and passionate graduate and undergraduate students. We have a research group page at the [Octera Github site](https://github.com/octeraIS/). I also collaborate with my own students, but also with other students, with other groups and faculty (like [CHISEL](https://thechiselgroup.org) and [SEGAL](https://http://thesegalgroup.org)), and industry. 

Prospective students [see here](/prospective/).

Current students should read through the [onboarding](https://github.com/neilernst/Onboarding) documents.
