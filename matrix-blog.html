They have supported exploration, kept detailed track of what was tried, and archive historical analysis.

I'll cover the pros and cons, and talk about the engineering concerns computational notebooks introduce.</td>

I think the explorations of a good scientist are just as creative, just as abductive, as those of musicians and artists. The notebooks capture the ideas and queries. In a way, the combinations and amounts of chemical reagents are no different than the sketches about light and perspective an artist might use.</td>

Recall that Darwin was on a 2 year voyage around the world on the Beagle - with no wifi! And his notes + specimens would have to form the basis for his future work. No going back to the Galapagos to refresh your memory. Here notebook is used as replication. Contrast these type of field notes with the notes taken in the laboratory; in the lab, all the &quot;subjects&quot; are still present, and we need to recapture their proportions. In the field, we are describing what already is, and we need to capture that unchanging state (unchanging in human terms).</td>

Her incomplete notes on the problem assigned her by her advisor, Franz Boas would be of no use to anyone else, however, "so I'm being as cryptic and illegible and brief as I like." The materials in the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mead/field-samoa.html">Library of Congress's Mead</a> collection support this distinction.

The Newton Project is dedicated to assembling all the works of Isaac Newton; an interesting anecdote is that when some of the papers were donated to Cambridge, a well-meaning archivist re-organized them into his own schema; thus destroying the potential 'meta-data' as to how Newton himself stored things. Even how you make notes could be relevant. This is obviously an issue with old, famous notebooks, but think about all the relatively unknown notebooks that will never be studied.</td>

<td>This is a screenshot of Donald Knuth's literate programming concept, from 1984. Literate programming mixes documentation and explanation with code, just like we see in modern computational notebooks. The problem Knuth was solving was the challenge of integrating software code with the documentation that described the purpose of that code. Even the earliest programs had a facility for annotating certain lines as comments, but literate programming was more than this. It was to end the (artifical) separation of design from code. This pedigree can be traced to various efforts over the years, mostly all unsuccessful, I would argue because the pudding in which the proof can be found is in fact the working bytecode that a program generates, and not human-readable comments. But you can trace several efforts here, arguably one of the most important being the notion of the "Read-Evaluate-Print" (REPL) paradigm behind interpreted languages like Perl, TCL, and now Python and R.</td>

<td>The worry I have is that notebooks are making replicable software really hard to write - much harder than writing code in Python or Fortran. And we already have enough problems getting people skilled up in these areas! <br/><br/>I think the takeaway message then is this. In the old days Newton, Franklin, and Mead never anticipated their personal notes and diaries would be used for replication, or out of context propaganda campaigns. The trouble is digital notebooks are absolutely going to be used for replication! We have already seen what can happen when software you never thought would be looked at, gets looked at by your well-funded enemies. Notebooks are merging this world of experimentation and prototyping with the world of reproducible, high quality software, and those two worlds have <em>very</em> different aims. The story thus far then is that notebooks like Jupyter have been fantastic for prototyping and self-talk, but hard to use for replication and sharing. The Reinart-Rogoff problem was a bad calculation in an Excel spreadsheet, leading to incorrect conclusions in their paper.</td>

Joel Grus, a software developer, strongly disagrees. I think from a software perspective, one extremely common problem is software that was written as a one-off, prototype exploration, that ends up becoming the production backbone of the entire enterprise. It is surprising how often developers don't expect their code to be around 20 or 30 years from now.</td>

But the notebooks---the right side---are not being used for building the telescope. Actually, the learning from the notebooks---the results obtained---will inform many future projects. For example, a PhD student who devises a better data processing pipeline stands a good chance of seeing that code build or be incorporated into later telescopes. In the same way, climate model exploratory code - what does this model of cloud formation do - quickly gets built into the main model product. SKA and similar projects have to balance this dichotomy of scientific inquiry and exploration, with a need for highly capable, engineered software.</td>

The code you write as a grad student is still code! It gets used! It informs policy decisions. The fact Netflix, for example, uses notebooks as a front-end to ML pipelines means major decisions are being made based on notebook results. Sure, experimenting on Kaggle problems is a largely individual and creative art, just like (say) Da Vinci's notebooks. But we rapidly progress from "here's a neat model" to "model now making credit scoring decisions". Data science creates software; software gets used.</td>

<td>This is even more true in organizations and IT projects. Consider a project to improve hiring outcomes. This is a reasonable objective: it could save money and time if the best people were identified earlier in the process.

The team might train a classifier on the resumes or applications submitted, and suggest this will pinpoint the best candidates. At this point, we are in the exploratory setting; various algorithms and parameters are tried until the &quot;best&quot; one is found. Now the pendulum swings to software engineering, because the algorithm---the analysis pipeline, really---is put into production. Our organization needs to support both the exploratory phase as well as the production phase, and different tools apply for both. Furthermore, this is clearly not just a technical challenge, but a managerial pone as well. The biggest issue is the need to consider whether your analysis pipeline is truly producing fair and ethical results (which so far, has not been the case).</td>

<td>The notebook as we know it---I've been using them for about 5 years now---has gotten vastly better. Tools like those from Netflix, IBM, etc will only make things nicer. But for the end user, it's all a bit chaotic. To me it seems like the early days of software development, with a plethora of standards and languages, and no clear consensus. This will of course change. But there seems to be some clear problems that will have to be addressed, and my students and I are actively working on some of these.</td>

<td>The first issue is that of parameters and configuration settings. What are the parameters? Where are they located in the notebook? What libraries and versions are we using? The ongoing challenge of managing environments with tools such as Conda or <code>virtualenv</code> are only magnified when we add another layer on top.</td>

<td>The second challenge is that of hidden state. When we run a program with the Python interpreter, it runs all the code it needs to. But in a notebook, the approach is more atomic. We run cells in any order we choose, and the dependencies between them, such as loading or cleaning data, are invisible. This has potential to cause errors, but also more subtle problems, such as depending on outdated data sources.</td>

<td>Our third challenge is not unique to notebooks, of course. Who hasn't worked on paper-2-v3-ne-final.docx? But think about this in the context of the beginning of the talk. What is the Marie Curie radioactive version of Jupiter notebooks? What will the Nobel prize winner of 2050 be using? How do we archive and store notebooks? How can our standard version control tools, developed for source code, work with the exploratory paradigms of notebooks?</td>

<td>Our fourth challenge is about testing and modularity. This is really about moving the science workflow into the software engineering pipeline of continuous integration and testing. Good modularity means parts of our workflow are easy to replace as needed, instead of existing in a single JSON textfile with a bunch of imports. These are lessons the software world has learned --- painfully --- over many years now.</td>

<td>The final problem is about education. Where and when do these practices get disseminated to students? Here in CS we use notebooks in the data mining course, but likely there is little time to explain best practices for notebook management. How do we teach notebooks in the context of software carpentry and reproducible science, if concepts like version control, package management etc are already foreign concepts? The real question is whether (data) science is about creating software?</td>

<td>As we move into the data science age, the software 2.0 age, we need to keep this continuum in mind. This axis runs both ways, in my view. Software engineering gets more to the right, and data science moves more to the left. That is, software will become more data science, and data science more software engineering.</td>

<td>This is an exciting time. Computational notebooks have become connected, replicable, interactive replacements for paper notebooks, but many open questions remain!
