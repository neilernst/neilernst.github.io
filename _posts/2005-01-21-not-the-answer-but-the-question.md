title: Not the Answer, but the Question
---

Doing a dissertation to me is about discovering what an interesting question is.  The first few months of your research, few years even, is all focused on determining what problems are hard, and what problems are solvable (in 3 years), and combining the two.  Master's level work is really about acquiring the knowledge to know what questions are relevant - at least from my experience.

Paul Graham makes a [similar point](http://paulgraham.com/hs.html), and it's common enough advice that nonetheless bears repeating: work on the hard problems.  His take on it is that these problems exist everywhere, and not just academia: Franz Beckenbauer's libero role, Ford's assembly-lines, and so on.
