Today I biked from my place at Spadina and Richmond to Lansdowne and Dupont. My idea was to explore the [new Railpath project](http://railpath.communitybicyclenetwork.org/), a bike path that should go from Dupont and Dundas W to Dundas and Lansdowne, and, hopefully, all the way to downtown (seems unlikely). Sadly, as the photo shows, this path is not yet complete.

ThisÂ  left me on the newly remodeled Lansdowne, which is a great improvement -- as Toronto streets go, which means the chance of death is just below 10%.

Anyway, eventually (when?) you should be able to cycle fearlessly along this path. Coming up from Lansdowne (from Queen), take a left on Dundas to the bike path, then veer right at the second road. This path will start just before the final bridge on Dundas.

I sure hope they manage to secure the rights to the rest of the corridor -- it goes all the way downtown to Union Station. If you look at [the cycling map](http://www.ibiketo.ca/torontobikeways.html), there is a big black hole of cycling-safe roads in the box between King and College, and Spadina to Roncesvalles. I don't understand why we need four major east-west car corridors (King, Queen, College, Dundas) and no cycling routes. Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.
