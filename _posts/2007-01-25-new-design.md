Non-feed readers of Semantic Werks will notice a new style for the site. Basically I realized that I didn't use any of the advanced features of K2, and was tired of being on the bleeding edge all the time. I've switched to what seems like a simpler variant, Binary Blue. Miss the rotatable header image though.
