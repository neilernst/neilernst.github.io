Most skeptics' views of climate change - anthropogenic global warming - seem to come down to the following template:

"The local temperature around <my city> is much cooler than <my faulty memory>Â  remembers. Therefore global warming is a crock."

Hence I have created a simple Python script which can auto-generate [this recollection](https://twitter.com/alex77/status/7948689548). It uses the monthly average temperature for my city, subtracts the current local temperature, and then, if the difference is positive, the Earth is warming. If the difference is negative, of course, hundreds of well-educated climate scientists are morons, incompetent, members of the Priory of Sion, or out to get you. Helpfully you can run this at particular times during the day to get the effect you wish.

This has the distinct advantage of not relying on spotty memory or aching joints to provide historical weather information. And thus is probably more sciency than most of the writing by Lawrence Solomon.
