Unstructured notes on CWA, principally the Abstraction Hierarchy:

the abstraction part of the AH is essentially a series of mental models workers use to understand the domain.  I'd been conceiving of it as one giant mental model, but each ladder step functions as a mental model, e.g., the mental model of functional purpose is how the worker conceives of the domain's goals.

CWA is not crisply divided between analysis and design.  At certain stages, such as WDA, it is clearly analysis that is to the fore; at middle conceptual steps, such as strategies and organizational analysis, the line is blurred, as the analysis starts to become more closely tied to design.  By the worker competencies stage, design is almost explicit.  To produce a complete worker competency analysis, suggestions should be made regarding design, or at least, become hard to resist suggesting.

It is at the situational assessment phase of a control task (decision ladder) that Rasmussen, 1978, found most mistakes happened.
