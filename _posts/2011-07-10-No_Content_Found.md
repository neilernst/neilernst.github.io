title: A few of my favorite papers

As I wrap up my thesis, I thought I'd share some of the papers I've read over the past few years that really stuck with me. Most will be fairly obscure to those not in the requirements engineering community, but deserve more attention.

* Reiter, a theory of diagnosis. What I love about this paper is how rigorous it is, and yet very approachable. There are well-constructed examples, then a degree of formality that makes it crystal clear what he had in mind.

* Jackson, The meaning of requirements. Jackson is the godfather of requirements research, and this paper shows that he has thought a lot about the issues. His approach is a little too specification oriented for me, but this paper operates at a high enough level to make it applicable to many, many problems.

* Mylopoulos, information modeling in the time of the revolution. A little self-serving, perhaps, but John's paper really crystallized the types of information modelling we do.

* NOrvig and Russell, AI: A modern approach. Not a paper, but super essential resource. Particularly handy when you read the wikipedia entry on resolution proofs, and realize it was written by a person with no communication skills. That's when I head to this book to get the simple version.

* Yu, i* 1997. Not rigorous, but the ideas expressed were so important that it has shaped an entire research area, that of social modelling.
