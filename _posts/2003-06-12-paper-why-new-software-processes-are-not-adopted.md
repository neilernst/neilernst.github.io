title: 'Paper:  Why new software processes are not adopted'
---

See [Shrimpbib reference](http://shrimpbib.chisel.cs.uvic.ca:8081/references.jsp?id=1&frameId=journalarticle_11) for more details.
A fairly lengthy paper on software adoption, examining current models for explaining adoption, and concluding with a suggestion that a big lack in the field is that there are no quantitative measurements of adoption processes - _viz._duration, cost, and implications of barriers and accelerators.  The best part of this paper is the extensive literature review and reference list that Rifkin produced.
What we call resistance may be nothing more pernicious than protecting our ability to pay our mortgages.
Contrasts the "grand processes" and the agile methods.  Adoption may be lower in the former because it must be adopted in its totality.
Presents 2 models of diffusion, which explain the dynamic forces in implementation and theories of resistance.  Explains how this may not be a linear phenomenon, as both the tech and the organization morph during the adoption process (mutual adaptation).  

Most relevant example to me seems to be the "double bubble" process, from Fowler and Rifkin, Sept 1990, Tech Report from the SEI (CMU/SEI-90-TR-24).  Tech producers are modelled as a large left-most bubble, intertwined with tech advocates in a smaller bubble.  On the right, a small bubble for tech receptors merges with the larger bubble of tech users (companies, govt, etc.)
