Friday was spent constructing 8 bookshelves with Lu and Dave. Very time consuming. Veronica gave an interesting talk about her time in Africa consulting. Received 25/30 on my AI midterm which I suppose is good, judging by the general hue-and-cry people were raising over their marks. Now on to the project, integrating DL into Protege somehow. A proof of concept work. This weekend I will be hacking around on that and on integrating a scripting environment into Shrimp with RHino. I think a Javascript tool sounds the best for simplicity and accessibility. The UofA project is still unclear to me as they are developing for Solaris. Which we don't have.
