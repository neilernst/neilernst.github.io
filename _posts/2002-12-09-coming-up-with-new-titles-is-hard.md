Fun weekend. Went to Pender Island with friends Joffre, Chris, and Bart to play Disc Golf on the 27 holer over there. Let me preface this by saying Pender Island is a lot hillier than I imagined! The course is really cool, built on a rocky hillock that also descends into deep rainforest. I actually did really well, 2 birdies and 8 over par, for which Chris bought me ice cream. Yes. I rule!  After that, we biked to   Beaumont marine park and  had some eats.  

As for actual work that I did, I think I am getting a better idea for how these ontologies will work together. I created a taxonomy of research interests and organizations, and I think I need some properties now to use with the instances: e.g. Person has-interest Subject. The issue is defining what are classes and what are instances, and  what are relations.    Still unclear on  that aspect. Anyhow  more later.
Ow, my  arms are sore..
