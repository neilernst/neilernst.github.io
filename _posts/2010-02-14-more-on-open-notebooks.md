I [recently posted](http://neilernst.net/2010/01/28/thoughts-on-open-notebooks-for-software-scientists/) about what an open notebook in software science might look like. I think I confused life stream (where life == work :) with notebook. From what I've seen looking at projects like OpenWetWare, they seem more like Trac or Github then a friendfeed account. You get a wiki to write on, image handling, etc., but it isn't automated: you have to enter all the data yourself.

This is incredibly useful, but am I right in thinking it is similar to tools software engineers have known for decades? It seems like the innovations are in collaborative editing, version control, and digital data.

What I was imagining was more automatic: whenever your microarray machine ran an experiment, it would auto-enter the results on your open notebook. Similarly for code you might run for statistical analysis (like the R workspace question I raised earlier).

I like the idea of 'recording' what you HAVE done (not what you will do, which is more brainstroming, mind-mapping, whiteboarding etc.). It is a very important part of selfish science, which is to say, self-replication (presumably the sine qua non of scientific reproducibility). Here are a few features I think are useful for personal lab notes:




  * A wiki with dates. 


  * Separate entries. 


  * Graphviz-Dot conversion. 


  * Semantic markup. 


  * Inline photos.


  * Inline LateX


I'm not saying these notebooks have no value: clearly they do. But I think there is a lot more that could be done with the concept. Particularly using linked data (oh noes! the semantic web!) to import other researchers' results.

What we really want is a list of steps - some small ['unit of science'](http://friendfeed.com/axiomsofchoice/85b96f76/whats-smallest-possible-scientific-artefact) that can be repeated. We should show this using process models, so we can model loops, branches, and possibly execute them, recompose them. [Google Wave](http://wave.google.com/) is touted as the best thing for this, and I think it's true. SAP has a [version of its business process editor](http://www.sapweb20.com/blog/2009/10/sapâ€™s-gravity-prototype-business-collaboration-using-google-wave/) in Wave, and Google [itself sees a need for it](http://www.whatisgooglewave.com/2010/02/11/my-extension-wish-workflow-in-wave/).  Its collaboration feature is useful, but I don't think it is the real advantage - yet. Right now, Wave's support for version control (well, history) and its ability to incorporate agents/bots and arbitrary Javascript extensions is more useful. For example, someone has written ['Watexy'](http://www.scienco.org/2009/watexy-latex-robot-for-google-wave/), a Wave bot which can interpret Latex equations.

It's truly an exciting time to be working in science.
