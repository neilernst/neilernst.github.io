title: Software research is interesting
---

This week I've met a number of people, both at [Massey](http://www.utoronto.ca/massey/) and at the [CS department](http://www.cs.toronto.edu), and been inspired by their research and interests: from ecology, to law, to dance history, to comparative literature, to medicine (including my wife's nursing education).  This has led me to wonder whether my research is equally ground-breaking and interesting.

I think at times it is easy to get lost in the depths, and forget how important some of the contributions are.  If I manage to produce a result in model evolution, that will undoubtedly help people in later years.  After all, a common thread in many of the programs people pursue is that computers, and software in particular, are highly involved.  Therefore any improvement I might bring will have profound and broad impact.

I also believe it is wrong to pursue things solely based on their sexy demos.  The underbelly of a sexy demo is a lot of struggle and hand-waving to make things Just Work.  And often, ground-breaking work is not recognized until years later, which is why some venues skip "Best Paper" awards and give out "Most Influential" 5 or 10 years later.  While it is important to [pursue important problems](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/dahlin/bookshelf/hamming.html), the identification of which a supervisor can help with, once you have, it is equally important to work on what you think is interesting, and work hard on that -- appreciating other research for its own merit, but not being overly distracted from the day to day work you do.
