title: New Visualization Metaphors for Ontologies
---

Here are some "new visual metaphors" for visualizing ontologies.  This is to solve the issue where all infovis research is concerned with is some neat-o new interface, not neccessarily useful.  Usefulness is overrated; it neither garners new funding nor generates acceptable papers. If you can't tell whether I'm serious or not you probably don't know me.
