title: My dangerous idea
---

In line with the ["World Question Center"](http://www.edge.org/q2006), and despite being a rather unaccomplished pseudo-academic, herewith my personal dangerous idea.

_What if software can't be engineered?_

I think it's fair to say that a lot of software engineering research is predicated on, or working towards, the idea that there is a basis for an engineering discipline of software.  Engineered software is reliable, repeatable, understandable, among other things.  Real software is none of those things, even with tremendous effort.  Perhaps it is the case that engineering software simply can't be done (for any definition of software that is non-trivial).

If that's the case, what are the implications?  I suggest that we ought to begin looking at the problem as a wicked problem, after the idea by [Rittel and Webber](http://www.citeulike.org/user/neilernst/article/460032), and expanded for this field by [Stahl](http://www.citeulike.org/user/neilernst/article/460033).  Such problems have no obvious solution, little agreement by stakeholders on what the problem is, and no clear way to identify success.  These problems are best solved by effective social practices, like competent management, and not by special techniques such as formal methods, requirements analysis, or programming language choice.

This implies that for complex software problems, we might be better off spending our time on the psychology of software design, and effective software management, rather than technical solutions.
