There's an excellent [IT project dashboard](http://it.usaspending.gov/) from the US government reporting on success/failure rates, project size, and amount of spending (which is frankly jaw-dropping). It is a very useful site, because most of the information we have seems to come from [self-interested](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/projectfailures/shocking-govt-it-failure-statistics/10490?tag=mantle_skin;content) consultants. It's certainly in their interests to emphasize how projects are always in a perpetual state of failure. Which doesn't mean they aren't, of course. If we look at the very coarse-grained US data, it's clear that an uncomfortably large number of projects are in trouble. E.g., the figure below shows 7% of projects are in serious trouble, and 34% need attention.

There's a reporting bias in the press, too, of course: [Man Bites Dog syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_bites_dog_(journalism)). If the project works and saves money, it won't make headlines. For example, the [Ontario Telemedicine Network](http://www.otn.ca/) connects physicians, nurses and patients online every single day, with high uptime rates. Every patient that doesn't have to travel to Toronto from Sudbury saves the government -- and the patient -- mucho dinero.

There's another comparison I rarely see, as well: how many projects of **any kind** are successful? If we look at the recent decision by the Canadian government to [dole out 'stimulus' money for infrastructure projects](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/end-of-stimulus-program-produces-construction-scramble/article1667390/?cmpid=rss1) (which invariably mean building new roads, for some reason), we see failure rates which are comparable to those in IT. For the 2 year, $4 billion fund, only 25% of projects were finished before the March 2011 deadline, with the most likely scenario being that some 900 projects will not meet the deadline. Manitoba is apparently hoping for favorable weather to meet the target.

Perhaps the difference is that when it is something physical, like a road, it is much harder to leave it half-finished then a piece of software.
