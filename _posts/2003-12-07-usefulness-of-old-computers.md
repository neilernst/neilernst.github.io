title: Usefulness of old computers
---

My belief is that old computers are more useful than old computers were 5 years ago.  For example, my current machine is an IBM Thinkpad R30, bought in September 2001, with a Celeron 700 processor running XP.  It can barely keep up with some of the newer machines we use in the lab, but nonethless, it's still worthy.  For example, it can still do digital image manipulation satisfactorily.  It can definitely handle word processing and business suite tasks.

5 years ago, you couldn't get an old (2yrs+) computer that was still useful.  Now, though, with most base models offering WiFi, USB, and sometimes Bluetooth or Firewire, the machine is more and more a central hub for other gadgets.  So I can maintain the usefulness of my machine by upgrading the external widgets I'm using - a better camera, for example.
