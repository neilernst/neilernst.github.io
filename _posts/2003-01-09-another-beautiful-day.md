title: another beautiful day
---

Today I have been writing in my thesis notes file, trying to get in the habit of writing and reading for the thesis for two hours each day. You see, the thesis just cannot be started the night before it seems! A discussion with Peggy has got us thinking about what it means to visualize knowledge, what role the bias of the framer plays in the visualization, and the nature of knowledge itself - can knowledge be visualized? Or are we really meaning the symbols are visualized?

I have also been putting together some slides for the lecture on Monday on knowledge representation.
