I've done this for a while now, but it occurred to me others might want to check this out:

The [SEWORLD](http://serl.cs.colorado.edu/~serl/seworld/) mailing list is a venue for most software engineering conference calls, including just about every obscure software workshop you could want. But getting a bunch of mail in your inbox is a bit of a pain. Using [Mailbucket](http://www.mailbucket.org/), I've converted the mailing list responses to an RSS feed which can be viewed, in my case, in Google Reader. I read about 32% of the 23 weekly posts. (I read 100% of the Third Bit posts though!)
