Well, after 2 days of code reading and debugging (and let me tell you, debugging is painful in PHP), I think the site is up and running.  Time will tell if anyone beside me uses it however.  There are still some problems but I think I've addressed the showstoppers.  The key is obviously to not delete people's posts as this would anger them exceedingly.  I think I will set up a weekly backup of my own to cover my ass (as we are still on the dev db server.)

Anyway, woohoo!
