title: 'Umberto Eco: Kant and the Platypus'
---

This is a book I'm currently reading, though reading is perhaps a mis-characterization of what is more like _skimming_, as I find most of the text over my head.  Not too far over, just enough to drown in a bathtub.  Eco is a philosopher/author/linguist/semiotician, which is longhand for _really smart guy_.  This book concerns how humans make sense of things, being a series of essays Eco wrote on the subject of signs, symbols, and semantics. This is relevant for me because a lot of what I am interested in is about humans and their environment, in particular how they understand it.  For example, the complexity of human conceptualization goes beyond a simple 'working memory' - 'short-term memory' - 'long-term memory' description of the process.  While that model is useful, I think making a serious attempt at grasping some of the deeper problems will really help motivate my research.  The complexity of semiotics is a bit much for me, but the arguments, like most of philosophy, concern simple things that aren't really that simple.
