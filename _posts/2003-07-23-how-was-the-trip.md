title: How was the trip?

Answer: fun, but tiring.  I always find (and it's confirmed by reading http://smontgomery.ca, Stu's travelogue) that you end up walking many miles while on tour.  Say you want to eat, and you're in London.  Lots of places, but for some reason I walk and walk, then you discover, 'hey, no places to eat now', and so you walk some more.  When you tally that with the actual hike I did in Ireland, it becomes a lot of leg work.

The conferences went really well, although it was frustrating to see that people were presenting work that we'd addressed with our tool.  It would have been a great venue for our work.  I think we have the edge in terms of how much work we've done, but in terms of publications or recognition we're behind.
