title: The conclusion
---

Some good meetings today. I sat in on the weekly editors meeting and, although a lot went over my head, nonetheless some was very interesting. I acquired a great paper by Natasha and Russ Altman from Stanford on managing the Gene Ontology using Protege. It is an interesting case that seems similar to the NCI. I was disappointed that the paper used the Ontoviz tab to visualize the model. I am frustrated that our tool can't even make it to be the default for something that simple.

After that meeting, I saw the man responsible for the disease modelling, Larry Wright, who gave a good illustration of just how complex our task is.
Following that, I talked with Mervi who runs the microarray project. It seems huge and very complicated, but also very exciting. All in all, the trip has garnered a wealth of information for the entire CHISEL team.
