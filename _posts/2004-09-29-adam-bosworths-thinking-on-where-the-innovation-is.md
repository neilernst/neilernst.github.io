title: Adam Bosworthâ€™s thinking on where the innovation is
---

[Great post](http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000026.html) from Adam Bosworth.  He mentions that the real action will be in leveraging existing platforms (i.e. the internet/web) to build communities.  The compelling reason to stay with something will be in how well it leverages this social aspect to deliver meaningful content - think EBay, Amazon, LiveJournal.  Stop thinking Longhorn, .Net, Linux.
