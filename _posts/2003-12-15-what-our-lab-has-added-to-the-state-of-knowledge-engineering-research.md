title: What our lab has added to the state of  knowledge engineering research
---

(Caution: somewhat self-congratulatory)   


When I first arrived at the CHISEL group in June of 2001, we had just finished porting our software understanding tool, Shrimp, to a knowledge engineering tool, Protege.  No students understood Protege all that well, Peggy had a better understanding, but it is safe to say that we were weak in the knowledge engineering background (part of the reason is the inexcusable lack of AI courses at UVic). 

Yet as I write this, in December of 2003, i.e. 30 months later, the lab has extensive understanding of what knowledge engineering is, and why it's important.  The word 'ontology' no longer is greeted with cries of horror, but rather, tears of joy (that last may be an exaggeration).  I am impressed with the improvement, and credit two things: first, the fortunate circumstances that brought Peggy, John Silva, and Mark Musen together; but mainly our supervisor and leader, Peggy Storey, for allowing her students the freedom to explore and learn a topic she can't have been too familiar with.  This lack of barriers enabled students like myself, Polly, Dave, and Lu to seek out new challenges in the field.
