title: Research statement

### Preamble 



[Herewith](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/) my subject-to-revisions research statement.  A research statement is like a mission statement for a researcher: a pithy, succinct summary of interests and goals.  It's a longer term driver for short-term research projects.  Ideally, all these projects would flow into this longer term vision.

My academic interests have always had some aspects of human-computer interaction and usability to them, starting perhaps with my experiences with DOS (De Operaating Siistemm) on my Dad's PC.  At the same time, I've been fascinated with technology (ICT, really) in non-traditional environments, such as developing countries, older persons, and remote communities.  One useful method that might help to address issues that ICT and non-traditional users is web-based computing, that is, offloading applications to remote servers.  Finally, closely related to this, mobile computing is clearly where the majority of new users of technology will first interact with complex systems.  Many more people own mobile phones and PDA (Personal Digital Assistants) then do laptops or PCs.



### Work analysis and complex systems



I want to examine and understand, long-term, the implications of humans interacting with AIs (Artificial Intelligence), e.g. AIs for driving, AIs for managing nuclear plants, etc.  Note that by AI I mean any mechanized or digital system for helping humans do things.  Yes, in this sense a car is an AI.  I suppose I'm uncomfortable with the traditional, [Turing Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Test) approach to defining an artificial intelligence.  It's clear that humans already have assistive technologies which play a huge role in our lives, from 'fly-by-wire' jet fighters to predictive text entry on cell phones.  What we are talking about is essentially the degree to which an AI replaces human functions.  They won't order and shop for groceries.  Yet.

Naturally this brings up interesting research questions.  How will (d0) we deal with them?  Will we be required to cede control?  How much control?  Where is the line to draw?  Where do we draw it?



### ICT and the 'digital divide'



Much has been written about the lack of equality of access to ICT.  Blacks, for example, are less likely than whites, in the U.S., to have access to connected computers.  I'm interested in examining these issues and their implications.  It's clear to me that ICT is about more than 'wiring' a community, or buying new machines.  ICT, to truly have an impact, needs a comprehensive strategy of deployment, including training, content development, and other supportive infrastructure.  How should we do this?  Why might ICT not be adopted?  What are the impacts on a community that has never had access to it before?



### Web services and distributed computing



Traditionally, computer users logged onto mainframes and used applications there.  Later, with the advent of the personal computer, applications were individual, with each person having their own copy of a text editor.  Client-server architectures allowed for some central control over applications, such as mail servers.  Now, a growing trend is to move common applications (initially simple, like web search, book ordering, address inquiries) onto globally accessible web servers.  The application is deconstructed into a set of services, such as a book selection service, a shopping cart service, and a checkout service, to use a simplistic example.  This simplifies maintenance - the provider specifies some form of contract with users as to what the service provides.  These distributed services promise to make previously silo'ed applications more accessible to other users.

I'm interested in how people understand and interact with complex systems like sensor networks, bioinformatics information, and automation.  This can be focused at the delivery side: the users; or at the design side: the builders.
