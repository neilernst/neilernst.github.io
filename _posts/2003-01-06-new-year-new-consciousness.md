I do not have much to add right now, as I just returned from a three week vacation in Ontario  (where I caught a cold of some sort but anyway..). Plans for this semester include TAing for Peggy in her Info Viz course, preparing 3 guest lectures for her, writing  thesis elements from 9-11 every morning, and working on the scripting elements of Shrimp.
I received an A- on my project and an A in the AI course I was taking. Satisfactory.
