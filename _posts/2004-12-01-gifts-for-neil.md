Here are some things to consider when shopping for my birthday or Christmas.

I have an Amazon wishlist where I add books I'd like to get, [view it](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/registry/wishlist/701-8222422-9922702).  I also have some camping gear I'd like, which is at [ REI](http://www.rei.com/online/store/GiftRegistryDetailsDisplay?registryId=GR115315&errorViewName=GiftRegistryErrorView).



Some other things I need or want:



  * external, USB 2.0, hard drive.  Preferably 120 GB or more.


  * -12 sleeping bag.  It's cold here.


  * good gloves, for going to school.  something that keeps the wind out.


  * peace
