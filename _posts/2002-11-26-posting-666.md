Jonathan put me on to more involved web log software at Drupal.org, which will hopefully replace this quick hack page sometime soon. The idea of categorizing web log entries is one I'm exploring in my project for Logic and AI class. I am thinking of designing a system using the FOAF RDF ontology. This will markup the various people in our group to enable machine queries on the various data. I will build this ontology in Protege.

The other tool I am working on is to create a Script Manager for SHriMP, which users can run scripts with. So far I've designed a simple GUI and integrated the BSF into it. I'm working on getting the list of commands that Kenny Wong's students have put together at the university of Alberta. Christmas draws near!
