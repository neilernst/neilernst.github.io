I'm moving more of my papers to be uploaded files, and not blog entries.  This has the advantage of storing the paper I'm referencing in the same location.  I may create a separate module - pdf-comment.module say - that will store a paper, and automatically update Shrimpbib for you as well on submit.  Shouldn't be too difficult.  This way you could store the paper's bibliographic data and make notes about it, as well as allowing others to use it.  I need to implement privacy settings so that you can allow others to see the file, but not the posting (as this may be private).
