title: More riveting content
---

Apparently this site isn't very interesting.  I'd buy that.  I'd really started this blog as a way of hashing out research ideas - writing clarifies - so there isn't much interesting personal content here.  I'm going to try and post more of that.  However, I'd like to stay away from rather off-the-cuff political or social criticism.  There's too much of that crap on the Net as it is.

Last weekend, K and I went up to Ottawa to visit with my brother.  He lives just off [Elgin](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=elgin%20street%2C%20ottawa&spn=0.022278%2C0.045324) near downtown in a house.  We had a great time, devoting Saturday to skating on the [Rideau](http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/skateway/index_e.asp), almost the length of it.  It's an amazingly fun thing to do.  Lots of people out at the same time, as that was probably one of the last good weekends for it.  I gather the Parks people had drilled holes in the ice and flooded it to make for good skating surfaces.

Now, I'm no skater, having grown up in Victoria, but K got me a pair of CCM skates for my [birthday](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilernst/4677332/), so I was all set.  No one mentioned the huge blisters you get from that much skating (12 km!), but I suppose I should have guessed.  My brother and I are about equal in the skating department, although he is more willing to risk his skeletal system trying to do fancy NHL power stops.  I feel very tall and far away from the hard ice when I'm doing this.

The next day we had breakfast at Dunn's diner, which had raised its prices for breakfast to a student-hostile 6.95.  Still O.K., but not the best deal.  Afterwards we secured some new wipers for the ride back (fortuitously as it turned out), then headed over to the [Museum of Civilisation](http://www.civilization.ca/).  Really neat building, but I almost feel like I would have had as good a time just looking at the cool Hall, and viewing the Parliament from across the Ottawa.  The Native exhibits were interesting, but nearly all West Coast aboriginal artifacts, which I'd seen (to a lesser extent, admittedly) in Victoria.  The wine and stamp exhibits weren't very exciting.  K dressed up as a French settler ( _habitant _), photo of which on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/neilernst) soon.

We finished by touring the Canadian hall, which was well set up, but by this point, inevitably it seems, legs were wearing out, and couldn't handle many more informative displays.  Really, all these attractions are much improved with knowledgeable guides to extract the meat of the exhibits.

That finished the trip really, we then headed back down the 401 to Toronto.  The brother was very hospitable and his roommates quite accomodating of the 3 people in the living room.  K and I made a massive amount of spaghetti - I know now what two boxes of noodles cooks up to - Saturday, which went over well.

Oh, and before I go, Lakeport Ale is not bad tasting and priced at $26.00 for 24 beers.  Two thumbs up for that.
