I'm still mulling over how best to implement these different ideas. I have a sample architecture for my project created, see it here. I'm still at the phase where all these complex parts are unclear to me, and I have a lot of implementation ahead of me. I think step 1 is to begin creating the ontology and the FOAF documents so that I can begin the next step of adding data. I also want to write a parser, but as I was mentioning to Polly, the problem is that no one is following a standard format for their blog. Perhaps I should set up something like Drupal for a few test cases to simplify. I'm also unclear on how I can parse the email we send to CHISEL and SHRIMP-DEV.
