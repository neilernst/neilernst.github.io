title: Microsummaries
---

There's a new feature in Firefox 2 that is perhaps undeservedly unheralded. Microsummaries are changing descriptors of the most current information on a website. For example, a CNN microsummary might be the current top story. When you add a CNN bookmark in your browser, a little drop-down box appears next to the site's default title. Clicking this will allow you to select instead the microsummary.Â  When you look at the bookmark after adding it, the microsummary will appear as the title, informing you of new content.

There are two useful plugins I'm using for this: [Microsummary Generator](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/3741/) allows a user to create a microsummary independent of the site, using (x?)path expressions; [Microsummary Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/4248/) stores these generated summaries for you. This isn't a replacement for a site feed, but I find it much simpler to keep up-to-date with. Now, if only Del.icio.us would support them somehow.
