title: Evaluating an extensible visualization framework for Jambalaya
---

I wish to evaluate (how is this distinct from validation?) my proposed research topic.  As I see it, there are two separate theses that need evalidation.  


  1. visualization provides useful cognitive support to allow users (modelers) to perform their work faster, more accurately, and more completely.
  2. domain specific customizations make Jambalaya (a tool that performs 1) more useable and useful, and thus more likely to be adopted.  

There are a few catches to those hypotheses.  In 1, we need to show that cognitive support is important in the knowledge engineering tools.  In 2, we need to show that being more useful and useable == increased adoption.
