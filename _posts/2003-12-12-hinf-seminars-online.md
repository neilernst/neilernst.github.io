title: HINF seminars online
---

The HINF school has stored their weekly seminars [online](http://hicweb.his.uvic.ca/hinf580/)  and they are all complete with text, chat, and slides.  Way ahead of the SENGCO, this is an excellent knowledge repository.  Check out this week's chat on the Semantic Web and Electronic Patient Records.
