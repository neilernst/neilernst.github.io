title: How to live life like NoMeansNo
---

[NoMeansNo](http://imdb.com?nomeansno) are a band from Victoria, BC.  They are nearly universally acclaimed for their creativity, intensity, and skill.  Their music is difficult to describe in one word, but it has a strong punk ethos to it -- independence, speed, tinged with anger and resentment of authority.  There are jazz and pop influences as well.  The lyrics are expressive, verging on the poetic.  It's good music, in short.

However, while I like listening to nearly all their oeuvre, I'm more impressed with how they approach life.  Keep in mind this impression isn't familiar with any intimate personal details, so if one of the band has done something awful, perhaps this is all blather.
