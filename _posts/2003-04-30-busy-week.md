Quite busy this week.  I need to start shedding tasks in order to concentrate on my thesis writing.  My goal of spending 2 hours a day writing it has fallen by the wayside somewhat.  I've accomplished quite a lot over the last weeks, however, so I'm not upset by it.  This summer is definitely shaping up differently than the last one though!

I've had a good talk with Holger about his SVG project.  I'm convinced Chisel should be following his approach, as he's done a lot of the work for us.  His project is at the [ACSE](http://www.acse.cs.uvic.ca/pages/acse_v1_0/acre_ve.html) site.
