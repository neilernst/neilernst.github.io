title: Goal models and requirements analysis
---

Certain members of my [research group](http://www.bul.utoronto.ca/labs-km.html) are interested in Goal Analysis.  Goal analysis, or goal modeling, is a technique which captures stakeholder goals during a software development task.  For example, your corporation may decide to 're-purpose' its music delivery service to serve videos as well.  Now, the traditional approach to this would involve a rough and tumble description of what the new application should do -- "serve movies!  fast!" -- and then set loose hordes of skilled hackers to build it.  And guess what?  This approach actually gets things done.  But not always.  Sometimes it results in [disasters](http://www.cfc.gc.ca/default_e.asp).
