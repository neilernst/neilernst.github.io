I just returned from the [ICSM conference](http://icsm07.ai.univ-paris8.fr/) and associated workshops in Paris, France (very nice, thank you). I have many notes on talks I saw, but herewith a few impressions:

ICSM is about software and machine artifacts, not requirements. Requirements come from on high, and the impetus for maintenance tasks is generally assumed to be well understood. It seemed a little like solving the problem of getting suburbanites to a downtown office by improving the highway signage, or improving offramps, but ignoring urban rail as an option altogether.

A discussion at the [workshop on evolvability](http://homepages.feis.herts.ac.uk/~comqcln/EN/software_evolvability07.html) spurred me to consider the 'smart-monkey syndrome'. My contention is that building software, while hard, is not the hardest problem. I think there is a lot of evidence for this, starting with Brooks's law, which is all about the external effects on software development, specifically communication.

Along the same lines, [Bruce Eckel](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=216326) posted a neat thought-experiment, asking, "If Microsoft, with all the money and smart people it has, can't release cool applications more than once every few years, than who can?" [Several responses](http://www.artima.com/forums/flat.jsp?forum=106&thread=216326) disagree, suggesting Microsoft is actually quite innovative. However, one of the respondents posted an argument with which I wholeheartedly concur, namely that it is again the external factors -- multi-national lawsuits, legacy support for code from the 80s, internal communication, device support, etc. -- that is the real bottleneck. This, I think, supports my contention that the building of software -- e.g., GMail -- is the easy part. I am almost certain that Microsoft engineers have had many of the same ideas as Google, but external reasons prevented their realization, such as corporate strategy, marketing, etc. Much as I have shied from the business side of software as fuzzy and pseudo-scientific (meaning that many of the claims in the literature are wholly unsubstantiated by evidence), I am coming to realize that it may be the one aspect that matters the most - and certainly more than language choice.
