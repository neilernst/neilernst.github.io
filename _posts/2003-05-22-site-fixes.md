I've attempted to upgrade Drupal but had problems with the pgsql side of things (as usual).  This is made more difficult because I don't have control over certain files on the system.  I went to CVS drupal, then back, but not switching the file upload module off caused problems.  Naturally this seems obvious now, but debugging running PHP code is very very hard.  Anyway, it's back to where it was, and I'm hoping to get another DB from Jill A. to experiment with.

bis bald!
