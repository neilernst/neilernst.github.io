Most of us have difficulty conceptualizing large amounts (or very tiny amounts, which is basically the same thing).  For instance, the notion of a light-year doesn't mean much to us.  A deficit in the U.S. of 3 trillion dollars is likewise unimaginable (to certain legislators great relief!).  The notion of a nano-machine is also hard to conceive - a miniature robot the size of a cell?  For that matter, how big is a cell?  A virus?

We humans construct abstractions and analogies to deal with these notions.  For example, if Betelgeuse in Orion is 650 light years away, we can try and understand that by saying, "If light takes 8 minutes to reach us from the Sun, then light from Orion takes much much longer".  Viruses are very very small, but we know they can get in our eyes, or noses.. we conceive of them as concepts rather than objects.

How do we deal with numbers that are less than infinite - say, the grains of sand on a beach, or atoms in an object - and try and conceptualize numbers that are approachable but vague?  For example, project estimation is very difficult to do - there are many outside considerations that impact the result.  Estimating is subject to chaos theory - perturbations and attractors - underlying structures we can't access from the surface.

Straight-forward estimates, such as man-months, have been shown many times to be irrelevant and incomplete (for example, by [Fred Brooks](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0201835959/104-4894965-4282324?v=glance)).  We ought to acknowledge this in managing projects, as well as in weather, stocks and other estimates - acknowledge the world is imperfect, as are we.
