What makes me nervous is that while it does seem crazy that a male with no more education than a high school diploma can get a 80,000$ a year job, with full benefits (essentially a job that can support a family with only one income), what is that job worth? 10$/hour? 20$?

There doesn't seem to be any obvious way of assessing this, other than relatively. A first-year worker on the assembly line should make what fraction of a first year C-level executive? And let's dispense with the fiction that a bonus means anything -- it's clearly just compensation. So should it be 200:1? 300:1? What? The argument is also that the CEO or equivalent doesn't get any job security, but still... we can probably account for that by factoring in average life expectancy and annual contributions. And let's assume we're in Canada so health care costs are borne by the state.

Can we quantify the relative contributions? The risks borne by the person? There seems to be some factors that can be applied to these numbers so we can start to determine what type of compensation is appropriate.

It's certainly not clear to me that $80k/year is an unreasonably large number, given the vast sums CEOs and financiers have looted from companies like Nortel and AIG over the years. Free market 'enthusiasts' like [Terence Corcoran](http://www.financialpost.com/analysis/columnists/TerenceCorcoran.html) picture a world in which a lucky few make >$100k/year, and the rest make 10$ an hour. That's mental. [Losing a Kodak plant](http://www.thestar.com/article/624526) and replacing it with a Wal-mart is not a good deal for our economy, long-term.

Personally, I think a diamond-shaped society [1] is more stable, more open, and a nicer place to live than the triangle-shaped ones. History would seem to bear that out.

[1] Diamond-shaped distribution meaning the majority of society makes near the median income; triangle-shaped meaning the majority of society makes near the bottom of the range.
