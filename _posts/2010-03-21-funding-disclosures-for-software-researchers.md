In an edition of [IEEE Computer](http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2008.298), the focus is service-oriented computing (SOC). There are several papers by academics researching service-orientation in its varied guises.

Which is all fine and dandy, but the central assumption is 'service orientation is better than <insert previous approach>'. And as near as I can tell, this assumption is totally unsupported by any large-scale empirical study. Most of the reasoning is based on anecdotal evidence, to wit: this SOC project went really well and is very effective. Which is very useful, but not convincing.

The same is true of autonomic computing. IBM published a [white-paper in 2003](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=642200) calling for a better way of doing computer management. IBM is profit-driven; most of their profits now come from the consulting side of the business. They also sponsor numerous academic collaborations. Consequently, there has been a flood of research into autonomicity, all of it founded on the central argument that the process-control/feedback loop it proposes makes computing [easier|cheaper|more effective]. A central argument which, like that of service-orientation above, has very little empirical support.

I mean, are DB2 servers with autonomic computing built-in better than otherwise? This is the lowest of low-hanging fruit for AC, so I'd like to see some data on total cost of ownership, etc.

My other rant is about the academics who write these studies. None of the journals or magazines I have seen require authors to reveal their funding sources (sometimes people reveal these deliberately, but I don't think it is policy that makes them do it). Shouldn't readers be told if a key author on the paper that hypes the products of one company that does SOC technology has been given a free copy, or been given funding support, or ...Â  That information is directly material to the research result!

In medicine, such circumstances would never be tolerated. Can you imagine Bayer funding a study on its drug that was then published and omitted this key detail? There would be near-universal outrage. And before you argue that computer science is hardly as safety-critical, let's consider that some of these studies might impact purchasing decisions at the U.S. military, at hospital IT departments, and so on.

We need to shift the field away from vendor-driven studies and more toward neutral, scientific evaluations. Perhaps my attitude will change when I'm seeking funding myself, though.
