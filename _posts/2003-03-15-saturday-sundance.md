Nice day today, stiff headwind for the row but going the other way was fun.

I think I've managed to get this site looking pretty nice by now, and the only really interesting thing to add would be a RDF integration with the taxonomy module.  Perhaps an SVG representation to replace the vocab selection above would be handy.

And smilies work now.... :)
