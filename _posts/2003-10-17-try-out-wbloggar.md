title: Try out w.bloggar
---

[w.bloggar](http://wbloggar.com) is a client-side windows app for posting blog entries without having to load the web page directly. It has the typical HTML GUI editor, with some pretty nice other features (I'm just exploring still).  I can also add standard HTML tags via the GUI.  You can also update posts from the interface by selecting them.  One thing it won't do (yet) is post with a category or taxonomy link, which is disappointing, but maybe we can add this in.

Install the software, then when it asks you for your site configuration, enter "chiselog.chisel.cs.uvic.ca" as the site URL and /xml-rpc.php for the API location.  Use your Drupal username and passwd for the software account.
