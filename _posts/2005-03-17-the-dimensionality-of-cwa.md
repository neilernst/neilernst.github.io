title: the Dimensionality of CWA
---

CWA currently uses 2 dimensions (2.5?) for the work domain analysis component, the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH).  [Vicente](http://www.citeulike.org/user/neilernst/article/130347) suggest a five level decomposition of the functional purpose (why a domain exists) of a domain into structural components.  These components are linked via means-ends indicating that they afford or constrain a component linked at a higher level.  The next four levels are Abstract Functions (the functions a domain has, in the abstract sense, e.g. it moves mass around, it uses energy), Generalized Functions (instantiated [ah!] functions which constrain or enable the abstract ones), Physical functions (how things are getting done), and Physical Form (what the domain looks like).

A second decomposition is into part-whole components.  Commonly represented on the horizontal axis, these are represented as System - SubSystem - Component decompositions in Vicente99, but any other part-whole divisions are valid.

There is a third, unstated dimension of analysis, namely the _topological_ connections between elements in the AH.  These links represent either physical connections or causal relationships (e.g. FWS A feeds Tank B).  In some cases these causal relations may be equivalent to means-ends (no?  Could also say FWS A constrains or enables Tank B).   I'm not clear on this.

There may also be any number of other relations.  A common one that comes to mind is the is-a relation (used frequently in ontologies to represent class-subclass relations), which structures a system into its aspects.  Where does is-a fit into the CWA picture?  From the AH, it would seem class-instance relations occur at the general function-abstract function level.  The word abstract usually implies its descendants inherit, or 'are', versions of the parent.  Isn't it more accurate to say, to use the text example, that mass source A has child heat-and-water input 1?
