title: Shirky on ontology
---

Clay Shirky [talks](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail470.html) about Ontology and Classification.  I use upper-case because I think this is what he is aiming at, the grand vision of an upper level ontology for everyone.  I don't think all, few in fact, who buy into OWL and RDF believe in this idea.  I certainly don't, and his points are mostly all well-taken:  

  * Semantics are in the user.  
  * Top-down categorization is over.  User designed, URL-based categories are going to take precedence in creating value.
  *  Predicate logic notions such as OWL are not useful.
  *  Schemes such as the LOC classifications really only designate where books should be shelved, not where ideas are stored.  Real categories are context-dependent and change.


But the idea that users/corporations may create their own ontologies is perfectly able to co-exist in this world.  Yes, predicate logic may be involved.  But that doesn't mean everyone has to subscribe to that ontology.  They can feel free to use it as they wish.  In this sense, I see OWL ontologies very much the same as [delicious](http://del.icio.us) tags - statements I make about how I see the world.  This is bottom-up categorization by definition (I am very close to the ground in the ontology world :))

In fact, OWL just gives those who need it, or want it, the tools to make more meaningful structure.  You can mimic OWL concepts in unstructured tagging schemes, but why bother?  Why not use constructs such as owl:DifferentFrom or owl:SubClassOf to build your own schema for sense-making?  Then, almost for free, you get to figure things out with a computer's help.  Oh, this guy also has a category called Country.  But he uses it differently.  So I need to tell people that.  Or, what other people have agreed to the world-view of the FOAF ontology?  And what is the picture associated with this nickname?

You could argue these questions don't have much value for most people, but I don't think one can argue it isn't a useful ability to have.   Stefano Mazzocchi makes [much the same point](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/85/) (in greater detail).
