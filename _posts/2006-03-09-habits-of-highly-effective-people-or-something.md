[This article from Fortune](http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/02/news/newsmakers/howiwork_fortune_032006/index.htm) is a fascinating series of interviews about how various high-powered people manage their days.  Very interesting insight into their lives. Commonalities seem to be personal assistants, and a reduced need for sleep - averaging between 5-6 hours.

And Starbucks opens 3 new locations _a day_?  They can't all be on Robson Street.  :)
