title: SOA, governance, and policies
---

It seems clear, based on Tim Menzies's informative talk on static code analysis, that if this problem (understanding software errors based on existing datasets) is so difficult (after 10-15 years, the best solutions are 80% effective), then we really have our work cut out for us in the area of SOA governance and monitoring. Hausi says, for instance, that we need to define indicators to monitor that will help us assess (legal) compliance and policy conformance. We can't even do this for software development, which we've been doing for decades.

I think this is what is exciting about the area of requirements evaluation and evolution. We have a chance to at least define a top-down approach to the problem: that is, defining what should be monitored, how to assess what conformance might mean for different stakeholders, etc. We aren't really approaching a solution to Yiqiao's level of problem: figuring out what to monitor in a running system, and figuring out what to do with that information.
