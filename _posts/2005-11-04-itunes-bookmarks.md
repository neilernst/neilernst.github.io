Listening to an audio book is now less frustrating after discovering the bookmark feature in iTunes 6 (pc version).  You can right-click a song, select "Get Information" and then go to the Options tab.  Near the bottom is an option to "Remember Playback Position", which works as expected.  No more scrolling through the timeline to find the last position.  Now if only it would detect when I fall asleep and stop playing .. :)
