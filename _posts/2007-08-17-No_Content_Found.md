title: 'As-is and to-be: an argument against ‘kitchen-sink’ modeling'
---

Like the [is-ought problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_problem) expressed by David Hume, we should be careful in making models not to merge tenses and verbs. One major purpose of modeling is to create a clear and accurate picture for decision-making. But in some models this clarity is obscured by including information on not just what the current state of the world is (indicative, is), but also what would be desirable (ought, optative).

In i* models, for example, the purpose is to enumerate alternatives and design opportunities. But the purpose is also to cast new light on the _existing_ state of affairs -- who depends on whom, etc. When these two states are combined, it becomes difficult to evaluate a design alternative: are we assuming Situation A will still hold; how can we be sure the Environment will still be the same;

Another confusion is between _structures _of the domain and _actions _in the domain. We often say that a certain task satisfies a particular goal; but we really want to enumerate, initially, these structural properties of the domain -- what exists **now** -- and allow the designer to choose the implementation path.

We should have 2 i* models: one enumerating the indicative constraints the work domain imposes; the other providing rationale and alternatives for optative desiderata in the Machine-to-be.
