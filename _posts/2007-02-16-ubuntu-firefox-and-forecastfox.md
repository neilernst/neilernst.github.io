title: Ubuntu, Firefox, and ForecastFox
---

Just a helpful hint: If Firefox 2 on Ubuntu (Edgy Eft) seems to be sucking a lot of CPU, make sure you aren't running ForecastFox. It's a little extension that polls for weather data. I'm not sure what is causing it to demand so many cycles, but it's a PITA. I disabled it and was rewarded by a much snappier browser.

And really, the weather isn't changing much in February -- cold, snowy, occasionally sunny.
