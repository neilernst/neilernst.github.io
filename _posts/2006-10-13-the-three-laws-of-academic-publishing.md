title: The Three Laws of Academic Publishing
---


	
  1. **The law of universal acceptance**: All papers will eventually be published.

	
  2. **Liaskos corollary of low standards**: There is a venue that will accept any paper.

	
  3. **Salay's query:** Would you want to attend a conference that accepted your paper?
