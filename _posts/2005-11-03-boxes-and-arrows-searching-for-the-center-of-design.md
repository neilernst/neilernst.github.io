[Boxes and Arrows: Searching for the center of design](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/searching_for_the_center_of_design.php)

Ron Baecker mentioned in the intro to Mik Lamming's talk that Mik's work was a good example of "value-centered design".  This post from a design blog explains what that term means.  I fear it has a ring of corporate-speak to it, but this post explains it well, essentially by highlighting the flaws in 'user-centered design' - it essentially ignores the business need behind the project in the first place.

It decries 'chooser-centered design', i.e. the notion that some forceful intelligence makes all the decisions in the end anyway.  However, I don't know how one can just get away from that phenomenon.  It seems that if you hire the author (Jess McMullin) to do VCD for you, he ends up being the 'chooser' in your project - admittedly a good one.  I suspect that ultimately, it matters less what focus you have for a project, and more about whether you followed a sane and arguably sensible process in designing the [interface|product|process].
