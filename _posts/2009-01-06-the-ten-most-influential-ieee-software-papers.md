A [recent article](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?isnumber=4721166&arnumber=4721174) in IEEE Software magazine studied the impacts of IEEE Software papers from 1984 onwards. The paper, well-hidden behind the cost wall, has a list of the 25 most cited articles in the magazine. I thought I'd reproduce the top 10 here with links to the abstracts, or, where possible, the paper itself. For those unfamiliar with the difference, a magazine article is typically a less-academic summarization of scholarly work, directed at both academics and practitioners.

Credit belongs to Daniel O'Leary, whose work this is.
