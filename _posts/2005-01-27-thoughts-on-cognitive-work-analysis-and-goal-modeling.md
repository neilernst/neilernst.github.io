title: Thoughts on Cognitive Work Analysis and Goal Modeling
---

I'm trying to reconcile these two areas of research.  [Cognitive Work Analysis](http://www.mie.utoronto.ca/labs/cel/research/frameworks/cwa.htm) is a framework for analysing how complex sociotechnical systems -- such as process control environments, medical devices, complex software projects -- should be designed to promote safety, health, and productivity of the users, and the system itself.  CWA has five suggested steps, beginning with an ecologically-based analysis of the work domain, and proceeding to a cogntivist analysis of worker competencies.  The previous steps constrain the latter stages.
