title: Rationality
---

I attended a lecture today on "Rationality". Speaking was [Thomas Schelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling), "Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Science in Memory of Alfred Nobel" winner in 2005 and [subject of some controversy](http://www.slate.com/id/2127862).

First, let's be clear, while I don't know much about Schelling's work myself, a cursory scan of his Wikipedia entry makes it clear he is a well-respected scholar.  I'm equally impressed that at the age of (apparently) 85/86 he still travels around eastern North America in February. I hate leaving the house to go on the subway. Respect.

_NÃ©anmoins,_ I found the talk uninspiring. Schelling took a leisurely stroll through objections to the application of strict rational choice theory (e.g., what causes 'irrational' behaviour?). Detailing these concerns, and acknowledging them, he never addressed what the implications were for his work. If passion affects strict rationality, how should international diplomacy be adjusted? He concluded the lecture by observing that faith and rationality seem contradictory, but neither elaborated nor presented further expansion on this very critical area of human relations.

My major concern with theorists such as Schelling is that they see things in black and white. Schelling lived through the Second World War and the Cold War. There your choices seemed clear: freedom versus oppression, us against them, and so on. This scenario (which I doubt ever really existed) lends itself nicely to reductionist game theory analysis that Schelling developed. But really, it is in the assumptions -- of rationality, of cultural understanding, of teleology -- that a truly useful understanding exists.

Some parts of post-modernism, constructivism, etc. are incomprehensible. However, I think the very notion that [there may be no objective truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_in_international_relations) can be a useful way of understanding human relations like those between Israelis and Palestinians.

I also don't understand the notion of rationality. [What is rational?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_choice_theory) Who defines rationality? Is it only a post-facto analysis? Is it even possible to assess whether, for example, [Ahmadinejad's rantings on the Holocaust](http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/013/271uktmd.asp) are rational, without the benefit of seeing the consequences?

Surely whatever we do at the time is 'rational', in that we DID that thing. There is a difference (as a commenter at the lecture noted) between rational choice and rationalizing (which is post-facto). If you define rationality as "doing what is most reasonable" than why would we not act rationally? Schelling talks about being driven by other desires, like sexual fervour -- for example, thinking with the brain in your pants. But who are we to say that choices made that favour sexual satisfaction aren't rational? Indeed, they might be most rational from an evolutionary standpoint. I think this notion of temporal order in rational choice is under-appreciated.

I was disappointed that these questions weren't raised or answered (and I'm culpable too). I suppose my conclusion from listening to Schelling is that a far more useful approach to the problem of human behaviour modeling has been done by AI researchers. There, the assumptions are clearer (due to a formal definition of the problem), and few, if any, attempt to apply their research (for example, [on planning with preferences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_planning)) to international relations. Dressing complexity up in the pseudo-mathematics of economics doesn't reduce the complexity, it just obscures the assumptions.
