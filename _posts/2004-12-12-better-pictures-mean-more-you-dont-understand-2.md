excerpt: 'There''s an interesting article up from the New Yorker on, among other things,
  <a href="http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?041213fa_fact">breast cancer screening</a>.  The
  author, <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/qid=1102903065/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/702-6334210-4864844">Malcolm
  Gladwell</a>, makes the case that although we have ever-increasing resolution in
  our data, and the things we do with the data are likewise more sophisticated, most
  of the ways we try to understand the data have failed to keep pace.


  In the specific case of breast cancer, there are numerous things in a mammogram
  that are either unknown or require an almost artistic ability to interpret correctly.  And
  various studies have shown that there is little consensus among radiologists on
  what a particular anomaly is.  Furthermore, science often doesn''t know whether
  a potential tumour might be fatal or not.  And finally, it would seem that, at least
  in some cases, a well-trained examiner can manually detect cancers better than the
  images can.


  A related point Gladwell highlights is the inability of the US Army to kill or achieve
  its targets.  He says:

  <blockquote>If you can aim at and hit the kitchen at the back of a house, after
  all, you don’t have to bomb the whole building. So your bomb can be two hundred
  pounds rather than a thousand. That means, in turn, that you can fit five times
  as many bombs on a single plane and hit five times as many targets in a single sortie,
  which sounds good—except that now you need to get intelligence on five times as
  many targets. And that intelligence has to be five times more specific, because
  if the target is in the bedroom and not the kitchen, you’ve missed him.</blockquote>


  This is an issue of fascination for me.  From my admittedly limited experience of
  research in computer science, I''ve noticed a lot of intense work on increasing
  the data that is gathered - more hierarchies, more complex models, better computer
  vision, speech recognition, etc.  And while there is work on human-computer interaction,
  I wonder how much work goes into understanding the limitations of humans and technology.  How
  can we help a doctor understand a mammogram better?  Surely there is something that
  can be done.


  Naturally, a lot of the advancement will depend on other disciplines.  Oncology
  needs to answer the questions about what malignant tumours ought to look like, and
  what they appear as in mammograms.  But I see a real opportunity for real-world,
  empirical solutions from HCI-like studies in CS.


  In the end, I suppose what is most intriguing about this article is that it resonates
  with my experiences with science.  Anyone who has done experimentation or analysis,
  anyone who has worked with real data, knows there are a lot of weird variables and
  outliers involved.  Usually, we just ignore them, since, and this is key, they don''t
  fit our preconceived model of what should be happening.  I think most people have
  had plenty of experience with theories that break down under actual conditions.  Science
  needs to be more adaptive to these cases, more tolerant of the outliers -- because
  while they may indeed be useless anomalies, a misfire of some sensor, they could
  also be important edge cases.'

There's an interesting article up from the New Yorker on, among other things, [breast cancer screening](http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?041213fa_fact).  The author, [Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/qid=1102903065/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/702-6334210-4864844), makes the case that although we have ever-increasing resolution in our data, and the things we do with the data are likewise more sophisticated, most of the ways we try to understand the data have failed to keep pace.

In the specific case of breast cancer, there are numerous things in a mammogram that are either unknown or require an almost artistic ability to interpret correctly.
