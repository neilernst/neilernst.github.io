title: Evaluation and education

[An excellent article](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/website/view.cgi?dbs=Article&key=1052247576) by Stephen Downes discusses evaluation and the idea that a controlled, quantitative experiment is always a useful approach.  He mentions, for example, that online learning, and indeed learning in general, is affected by many, many factors, and a test which seeks to prove that e-learning does or does not improve test scores is really pretty silly -- "the conclusions are contained in the question".

In our context, I think this is like people trying to show that a 3-dimensional treemap is better than the 2-d version for certain tasks.
