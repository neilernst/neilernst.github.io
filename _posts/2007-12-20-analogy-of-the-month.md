From Steve Yegge, on [why code size is a problem](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html):


<blockquote>Going back to our crazed Tetris game, imagine that you have a tool that lets you manage huge Tetris screens that are hundreds of stories high. In this scenario, stacking the pieces isn't a problem, so there's no need to be able to eliminate pieces. This is the cultural problem: they don't realize they're not actually playing the right game anymore.</blockquote>
