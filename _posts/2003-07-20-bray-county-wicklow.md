Today was great.  I walked from the hostel in the middle of nowhere to the town of Enniskerry where some shopkeeper tried to cheat me, luckily I speak English!.  I took the bus to the city of Bray on the Irish sea, where my booked room at the Esplanade was full.  I was fed a lunch, gratis, however, and given another room uptown away from the seaside, at the Woodland.  A long walk to the ocean, nonetheless I am paying 15 Euro less here, and the room is good.  I fell asleep on my bed for an hour - a bed with springs and everything - and then decided to make my way to the ocean via the peak of Bray Head.  A nice view, but I am always reminded of the West Coast here.  What I mean is, these views seem quite similar to those from Finlayson or East Sooke Park.  See my gallery for more.  I climbed down to the town and wandered about looking for an internet cafe, after going for a brief dip in the Irish Sea.  No Internet cafe, so I ducked into the pub to have a pint (slow in coming) and then check out some Irish rap on the festival stage (and some bad boy bands).  I worked my way down the three pubs and finished off 4 Guiness while watching hurling and Gaelic football and talking to drunken Irishmen.  The evening ended with a meal of hamburger and chips and an ice cream for the walk home.
