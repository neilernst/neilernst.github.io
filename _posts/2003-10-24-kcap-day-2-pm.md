Push Singh and Barbara Barry - Collecting commonsense experience (MIT)
  

[Open Mind project](http://omex.media.mit.edu/cgi-bin/omex.cgi/om) - use websites to elicit common sense knowledge (638,000 knowledge items)
Singh is Minsky's Ph.D. student.    

Effectively "postponed the problem of integrating the knowledge"
  
Everyone has his own personal ontology.  

squishy knowledge e.g. "shampoo is in the bathroom" which shampoo, which bathroom, all bathrooms?  

Could also make reasoning more tolerant of imprecision.  

Use knowledge for things like image annotation, topic spotting, web search.  Need some kind of corpus before you can do anything neat with common-sense.  For example, the IUI paper on affective emotion recognition in email.  SB for example is limited by lack of other technologies.
