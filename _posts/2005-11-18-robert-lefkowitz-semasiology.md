title: 'Robert Lefkowitz: Semasiology'
---

[This](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail662.html) is one of the best talks I've listened to, and I imagine it was just as good, if not better, in person. Lefkowitz defines the 'storyteller' style of presenting -- you can sense he has his facts together, knows what he wants to talk about, and is comfortable digressing briefly. I doubt you would even need slides if you could present like this.
