title: End-user software engineering
---

Today I [stumbled](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OOPSLA2005.html) [upon](http://ist.psu.edu/rosson/) a [research consortium](http://eusesconsortium.org/) dedicated to 'end-user software engineering'.  The gist of their research is to put more programming ability in the hands of the user.  Several papers are devoted to the area of spreadsheet construction, an area where end-users can exert a great deal of influence in programming (though they may not realize it).  Several interesting papers there; they seem to build on the work that Bonnie Nardi did on [customization and end-users](http://www.citeulike.org/user/neilernst/article/121816) in the 80s (and information ecologies in general).  There is an [interesting workshop](http://eusesconsortium.org/CHI06-weuse-prelimAnnounce.pdf) upcoming in Montreal, at CHI2006.

I think most of this work is consistent with where I see my research heading.  I'm interested in end-user _requirements_ engineering.  The difference which may not be apparent initially is that the requirements phase is definitely high-level design work.  The 'programming' end of things is more nuts and bolts construction work.  At least, this is how I've seen it phrased, although I'm not entirely comfortable with the distinction between 'building' and 'engineering' that some researchers have put forward.

I think the [RSR](http://www.neilernst.net/blog/archives/2005/rsr-implementing-really-simple-requirements/) philosophy is a large part of this, and some of the papers the EUSE people published (to great acclaim: one was an ICSE best paper) mention the notion of WYSIWYT (what you see is what you test), which aligns somewhat with RSR.  It will be interesting to examine their work and determine what their experiences suggest some of the pitfalls of working with end-users may be.
