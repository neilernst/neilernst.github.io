Consider the case of an incompetent pathologist who delivers incomplete reports, misses diagnoses, etc. All problems that someone without medical training could see: the report is poorly written, the patient later found a lump when told it was nothing, the office is a mess, and so on. On the one hand, this is 'just' a bad employee: he or she needs to be fired for incompetence. But when the person stays on for years after management knows about the problems, it's no longer the employee that is the problem: the bosses are.

My point is that it is easy to identify one-off solutions to apparently isolated problems, such as hiring better people. But the big problem is organizational. What are the expected standards? What are the common expectations for all departments? To my mind these are developed by creating first an organizational focus (a business statement for lack of a better term), then a set of policies that must be adhered to to meet that focus. In this case, it might take the form of required report formats, mandatory reviews of outcomes, outside audits of medical expertise, etc. But what is really necessary is the organizational maturity to keep everyone on the same path. It's often difficult to make the decision to fire someone, particularly someone with a great deal of experience and many friends. But that is the reason the executives are paid so outlandishly.

I'm beginning to feel the same is true for software development. We spend so much time arguing about languages, models, testing, agile vs. waterfall, etc., that I think we forget that these 'best practices' are really irrelevant if there is not the organizational maturity and interest in following them. Agile is better than waterfall? Not in a company that thinks agile means "no documentation". I guess I'm growing more and more convinced that the important aspects are organizational: do you meet the Joel Test? CMMI level 5? These factors, I would suggest, are better predictors of project success than whether one uses REST or WS-*, SOA or J2EE. It's a company that has the discipline and determination to insist on excellence that will be successful, not the one that hits all the buzzwords.
