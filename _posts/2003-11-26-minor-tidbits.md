  * The W3C is holding a teleconference on Accessibility and Visualizations and is inviting presentations: see [here for](http://www.w3.org/WAI/RD/2003/09/call-vis-papers.html) more.


  * [Someone else is working on](http://psi.ontopia.net/rdf2tm/) RDF to Topic Map conversion.  The difference with [Piotr's work](http://www.ideanest.com) with Braque is that this mapping takes place at a lower-level (syntactic) so you would lose the higher-level meaning of the ontology (semantics).   
  
Just thought I'd write a little more on explaining this issue.
