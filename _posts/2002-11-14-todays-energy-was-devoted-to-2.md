Access!. What an irritating tool. I don't mind a tool that lacks functionality as long as it tells you that it can't do that. What is really annoying is the way it does things and then doesn't do them. Anyway, I have designed a form for access that can display the survey results nicely, and can be fairly easily updated with new results.

I also looked briefly at scripting as mentioned below. So much for Thursday being my "reading" day. I am starting to get nervous about finishing 100+ pages in the next 9 months. Somehow I seem very far away. <come into the light Neil!<.
