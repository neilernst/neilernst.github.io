title: Notes on Kingwell's "Better Living"
---

Kingwell, Mark.  1998.  Better Living: In Pursuit of Happiness from Plato to Prozak.  Viking Press, Toronto.



I think what I liked about this book the most was the way Kingwell takes what for me is the real beauty of studying philosophy, namely that its subjects are relevant to everyone, and (aggressively) uses that familiarity to build and sustain an argument.   He is confident in his ideas and their expression, and not afraid to challenge the reader -- on their own terms, not in abstruse jargon -- to an understanding of his argument.  I find he is sometimes overly flippant or unctuous, dropping quotes and references at will, but it doesn't detract from the overall message.
