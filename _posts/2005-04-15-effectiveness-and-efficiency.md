title: Effectiveness and efficiency
---

Good definition:
Effectiveness is whether a process (black box) achieves required results (from Shah,  2003, _Public Health and Preventive Medicine in Canada_).
Efficiency is the result achieved over some measure, such as time, cost, personnel.

So an effective medical treatment for cancer kills the cancer (perhaps to some statistical limit, such as 95% of the cancer, 19 times out of 20).
An efficient treatment kills the cancer, and does it faster, or cheaper, or with fewer side-effects.

Note these two are related.  That is, if I have an effective treatment, but not an efficient one (e.g., I kill the cancerous cells, but it takes 12 months) then effectiveness in other areas (e.g., no metastasis) may be affected.
