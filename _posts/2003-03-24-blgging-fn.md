Yeah, the taxonomy is really silly right now.  I want to be able to add in an RDF file and use that (e.g. part of the taxonomy mgmt page would be to specify an RDF schema or file that you wanted to use and it would load it for you).  Gotta roll my own I guess.
Today I worked on the Infovis paper, which is coming along quite well.  Peggy pointed me to a good paper from 1990 on visual knowledge engineering which has many relevancies to what we are working on.  I don't have a link off the top of my head.  Must figure out a way to capture my papers web-wise so this is simpler (also local d/l for fellow CHISELers).
Off to l'autobus!
