Well, not a lot accomplished today, as it seems that someone or something has damaged my laptop.  I suspect MS myself but there is a slight chance that it was a hacker.  I am backing all my files to disk and then going to try and reinstall XP on the machine to try and repair the damn thing.  I'm tempted to wipe it clean though and see if we can't speed the monster up a little.  hmmh.
Peggy and I had a good discussion today on the future of SHriMP - when to move on, what to replace it with, etc.  I'm excited to see we're on the same page with our thoughts on what the point of research is, and I'm motivated now with the topic that I seem to be using.  I think it feels right now (which metrics didn't really feel like).  This weekend I'd like to draw out that idea a little more, explore what I mean by Adoption-Centered KE, and see where I can take it.
