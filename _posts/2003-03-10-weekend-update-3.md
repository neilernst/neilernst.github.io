title: Weekend update
---

I did this once and the tool allowed me to make it private, however, now I must determine where it gets stored!  It's too private.  Anyway, the weekend was productive and tiring.  Saturday I rowed in the early AM, followed by a 3 hour boat cleanup; the Po-Cock single is now gleaming white and quite new looking.  Still heavy as a pair however.  Sunday saw me proofing the paper Jeff, Rob, Xiaomin and Peggy are submitting to Softvis.  It's very good, and describes in detail the integration process in Eclipse (which I understood poorly before now).  I think it's an excellent example of how to leverage a well-supported community tool to deliver new and innovative products.  What is hampering adoption for tools like SHriMP is the requirement that you must download and learn a new tool.  I think the best way around this is a two step process: 

  1. ensure the tool is well-integrated into an existing framework (eg. Eclipse) and 
  2. make the tool have a gentle learning curve (without restricting the amount that can be learned.
 In other words, we must allow people to gradually get their feet wet rather than hurling them (often screaming) into the deep end of the pool.

So what are the expectations for Protege and KE?  Peggy was thinking about integrating the two, however, I suspect Protege has a large enough (in this domain anyway) base of users to allow us to leverage it in the same way we do with Eclipse.  Nonetheless, if we want to get more actual use of it (and not just interested downloads) we should focus on making it as simple to use (and as useful for small tasks) as Ontoviz, **at a minimum**.  Otherwise people like Natasha will just never get to see the more powerful exploration features we have spent so long developing.
