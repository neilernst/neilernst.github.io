title: If your newspaper won’t offend you …

I think it's a bad thing when you like what you read in the paper. Honestly, do we really need more opinions confirming what we already think? I feel this way about the globe, despite their good student delivery discounts. I already agree with 9/10ths of what they say. It's pretty sycophantic, really, just reading a paper that you like.

The Post is better; many of their articles are written by people -- yes, you, Terry Corcoran!  --

who are firmly opposite many of my beliefs.  It's fun and challenging to try and pick holes in their argument. I think if you already are predisposed to agree, those holes can be covered over by the vanity-pleasing effect of concurrence.


The Star, though, deserves special treatment. All too many of the opinions in that paper are just poorly written and downright incomprehensible -- Slinger? What the hell are you talking about? Pragmatically though, and I'm nothing if not pragmatic, for 4$ a month, I'd subscribe to just about anything.
