title: Another weekend update
---

Finished the paper on Cognitive Questions in SW Vis today, which really resonated with me. New student Ian Bull showed up today from CAS Toronto, working on some cool stuff too. Listening to his talk confirmed my dislike for projects with no firm grounding - so I get ready for Washington eager to show that knowledge visualization is indeed essential to understanding a system.

I had a productive meeting today with the Chisel people interested in the NCI project - the Jambalaya team, as it were - and I believe I have a good amount of work to perform while over there.
