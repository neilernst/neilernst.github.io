title: OpenOME research
---

Yesterday I met with [Yijun Yu](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yijun/) to discuss potential research work on the [OpenOME](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/km/openome) goal modeling tool.

Yijun showed me a good site, Tao Xie's list of [SENG conferences and dates.](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/xie/seconferences.htm)

One potential project is Visualization in Goal Modeling, an under-explored area.  We identified [SoftVis](http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~diehl/softvis/org/softvis06/) as a good candidate venue for our proposed research (due: Dec 1).  We'd like to add goal colouring (specifically, the conflicts between deniable and satisficeable nodes) to OME.  This allows us to visualize how qualities affect system behaviour.  Tools exist to do analysis at the code and model levels.  Other variables of interest, beside performance, include scalability and usability.

We should use some example scenarios for the project, likely from the Kid's Help Phone project (which is of sufficient size).  Yijun's previous work on [CacheViz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yijun/CacheVisualization.html) and ISV will provide a codebase to build from.
