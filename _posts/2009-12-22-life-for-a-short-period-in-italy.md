Specifically, [Trento](http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Vela,+Trento,+Italy&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=34.594707,92.724609&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Vela,+Trento,+Trentino-Alto+Adige%2FS%C3%BCdtirol,+Italy&ll=46.083233,11.111727&spn=0.036196,0.090551&z=14), north-eastern Italy. More like Austria than traditional images of Italy.



Introduction





I am staying in Trento for three months as a visiting student. My apartment is in Vela, on the northeast side of Trento, just under the Sorasass cliffs on the right bank of the Adige. I'll post a few comments I have that might help others who find themselves in Trento and know little Italian.





-- Bus tickets can be bought at any tabaccheria (newstands with letter T on the sign). It is 8€ for 10 tickets. A ticket is good for 70 minutes of travel on the city bus, and you need to validate it each time you get on the bus. From Vela, you will need bus number 2, and get off at Piazza Dante (the train station). The schedules are avaible at the Trento Trasporti site. From Piazza Dante hop on Bus 5 to Povo, if you are heading to the Engineering Faculty or the Science Faculty.





-- grocery stores seem to be either Poli or Coop. If you live in Vela, there is a Coop store just down the road, in the main village, past the church on the north side. There is also a bank machine and a hotel with a bar and ristorante. I found the prices reasonable enough.





To walk from Vela to downtown Trento, I recommend going back to Vela, then taking the eastern road out of the village (past the hotel). This leads through a sketchy underpass that is very narrow and has blind approaches on each side. I generally quickened my pace through here. Follow that road to a roundabout, then take the immediate left that jogs back. Use it to go through the underpass again, and then follow the river to the bridge. You can take this bridge, or walk down the river a little to the next bridge, which is closer to the train station. I didn't find walking too bad, other than the lack of sidewalks. Italians are generally pretty good about non-automobiles on the road, although I always tried to make myself visible. It takes about 30 minutes quick pace to get to Piazza Dante.





You can walk up to Povo if you want. There is a path just at the end of Via Grazioli. As Grazioli ends, keep heading up hill, but take the middle route. There is a wooden sign with green painting -- follow this. Eventually you come up to a bridge over the stream -- pretty neat bridge, actually -- and then the main path up the hill. Follow this until you reach the road again, and the Facultá di Ingegneria. Cross the road over to the bus stop -- carefully -- and keep walking along the sidewalk and take the first left, a narrow little road next to a trattoria. At the top of this road you reach a train station/stop. Cross the tracks -- again, carefully, as the train runs here -- then continue up the road. It takes about 40 minutes to reach the via Sommarive, and the Faculty.





Activities





Vela is a little dead. There can be student parties in the big house which is in the field, south of the village. There is a great hiking trail, SAT trail 627, which heads up to the very top of that cliff looming over the town. Head north out of Vela, following the road. When you come to a fork, with the main road veering right towards the river, take the left fork. About 10 metres down, there should be a sign indicating the trail number.





It's a steep trail to begin, as all these trails seem to be, and a bit of a scramble up the forested hill. After 20 minutes, you reach a vineyard perched on the top of the little bluff. Head right, and find the start of the slightly easier trail, carved out of the rock. It's another fairly steep climb to the top of this mountain, but eventually you reach a flat part. The trail then jogs right, to the higher ground, and a stone road that my imagination told me was once trundled by hand-pulled cannon. Be glad you are not pulling a canon up here. The road is more gradual here, and after a few switchbacks starts to follow the ridgeline, right along the face of the cliff. The exposure is minimal, but don't stumble. There are plenty of rocks in the way. You soon reach the top of this cliff, and there is an under-used path going right, to a nice picnic spot dangling over the 500metre drop to the valley floor. The main trail continues north-west, down the hill now, til it reaches an official picnic are, Dos Pini. Here you can find wimpy hikers who headed up from Cimbale, to the west. Keep heading up the trail to the north-west. After a few hundred metres (straight, not up), you come to a diversion which is a neat reconstructed firing emplacement for the Austrians in WWI. Nicely done, but it makes you wonder what they were defending way up here. After checking that out, follow the trail up the hill, not back the way you came, to catch up to the main 627 path. You now follow a fairly narrow path with many rocks, and a steep drop on the side. I couldn't read the warning sign properly, but the gist was something like "loose footing, keep watch of kids". There are spectacular views of the valley to the south, and the ugly industrial park that is the north of Trento.





This was where I turned around, having no time to see where it finished. At any rate, round-trip time was two hours, albeit with some running, and it was literally 'steps' from my apartment.

My apartment was in [Vela](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=via+santi+cosma+e+damiano+83,+vela&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=41.275297,89.736328&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=A), on the northeast side of Trento, just under the Sorasass cliffs on the right bank of the Adige.

  * Bus tickets can be bought at any tabaccheria (newstands with letter T on the sign). It is 8€ for 10 tickets. A ticket is good for 70 minutes of travel on the city bus, and you need to validate it each time you get on the bus (which is silly, but anyway). From Vela, you will need bus number 2, and get off at Piazza Dante (the train station). The schedules are available at the [Trentino Trasporti](http://www.ttesercizio.it/Orari/Urbano/Trento/Default.aspx) site.

There is also a bank machine and a hotel with a bar and ristorante. I found the prices reasonable enough. Keep in mind that most stores in Italy close on Sunday, and often either Monday or Wednesday afternoons (pomeriggio).



To walk from Vela to downtown Trento, I recommend going [via this route](http://maps.google.ca/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=110770646396580253594.0004785911285de0b4d84&ll=46.07453,11.11152&spn=0.009393,0.022638&z=16). I didn't find walking too bad, other than the lack of sidewalks. Italians are generally pretty good about non-automobiles on the road, although I always tried to make myself visible. It takes about 30 minutes quick pace to get to Piazza Dante.

You can walk up to Povo if you want. There is a path just at the end of via Grazioli. As Grazioli ends, keep heading up hill to the left of the monastery, but take the middle route. There is a wooden sign with green painting -- follow this. Eventually you come up to a bridge over the stream -- pretty neat bridge, actually -- and then a main path up the hill. Follow this until you reach the road again, and the _Facultá di Ingegneria_.

It takes about 40 minutes to reach the via Sommarive, and the Faculty.



### Jogging/Cycling



So the stereotype of Europe is pedestrian and bike friendly, and this is certainly true in the _centro città._ However, outside of downtown, things are a mess. Vela in particular is entirely car-oriented (and annoying unmuffled dirtbikes!). There is however a good route to downtown that doesn't involve navigating roads without sidewalks (much). See [my map here](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=110770646396580253594.0004785911285de0b4d84&ll=46.07335,11.117778&spn=0.016523,0.039096&t=h&z=15).

For jogging, I found a nice route that is similar to the walking route, but involves some elevation for heart-pounding. You can see the details at [MapMyRun](http://www.mapmyrun.com/run/italy/trento/162125786667570952). About 5.5k.



### Trekking



Italians in this region love hiking, and have a well-organized series of trails. There are Trento city trails, with wooden signs; Trentino (province) trails, with red and white flags and plastic signs; and via ferrate, which require special equipment. I bought a map for part of the region (the western side of town, Monte Bondone) at the tourist centre for 1€, and bookstores - librerie -  sell more extensive guidebooks. In general you shouldn't need more than a sturdy pair of shoes and some water. Being Europe, you are usually never far from civilization (take the usual caution when in the alpine, of course). Signs are pretty extensive and clear. The numbers are not distance, but time (e.g, 1.0 is '1 hour'). This was a little disconcerting til I figured it out! Below I list some of the climbs I did. You can also get good info here or here.
