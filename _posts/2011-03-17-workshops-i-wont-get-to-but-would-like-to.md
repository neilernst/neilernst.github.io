title: Workshops I won't get to ... but would like to
---

Every major conference in CS typically has four or more associated workshops. A workshop is a half-day/full-day affair which (sadly) take on the feel of mini-conferences, with CFPs, program committees, and rejections. Moshe Vardi makes some good points in [his essay about how workshops](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/1/103228-where-have-all-the-workshops-gone/fulltext) are failing us as a community.

However, they are a great place to chat with people in your area who are interested in the same things, and the coffee breaks, at least, are worth a dozen emails.

Here's a few that I wish I could (have gone / go) to.



	
  * [Living with Inconsistency](http://www.sea.uni-linz.ac.at/lwi/)

	
  * [CHASE 2.0](http://www.itu.dk/people/ydi/CHASE2010.html) - Cooperative Aspects of Software Engineering

	
  * The [Future Of Requirements Engineering For Self-Adaptive Systems](http://www.resg.org.uk/index.php/Self_Adaptive_Systems_in_RE_2010)

	
  * [WSRCC](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/wsrcc/) - Software Research and Climate Change

	
  * [Web2SE](http://sites.google.com/site/web2se/) - Web 2.0 and Software Engineering

	
  * [SEAMS](http://2011.seams-symposia.org/) - Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems


We should re-invent the workshop model so we can *all* attend the workshops we find interesting, no? Stay tuned for more thoughts on the matter.
