It's time I think to begin concentrating less on the fun application development - _viz._ this site - and more on getting the meat of this multi-year sojourn, the **thesis** out of the way.  I really enjoy futzing around with various neat-o technologies, but I'm itching to get some serious words down.

The thing is, my writing style (rather, the way I go about writing) is sporadic.  It takes me a long time to get up to full bore, but when I do I can churn out the pages something fierce.  I'd like to start this process now, since I know there will be issues that will come up and need more work - say more field trips, more research, etc.  I want to start identifying these things now before I'm too far along. }:)

Writing now will be an opportunity to coalesce all the work I've done so far to see where I've gotten.

Still, a few projects are on the go, NCI for one, a few tweaks on this beast for another, plus a look at web services. 8)
