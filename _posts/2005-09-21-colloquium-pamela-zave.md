title: 'Colloquium: Pamela Zave'

Pamela Zave, of [Four Dark Corners](http://www.citeulike.org/user/neilernst/article/120111) fame, gave a presentation on IP telephony and feature interaction today.  Some notes:



	
  * Features are things like caller id, find me, etc.  Interactions between features (churn) creates problems.

	
  * Can interactions and features all be defined as functional aspects of the telephony system?  Perhaps some 'features' are socially constructed, e.g. using picture phones to capture breaking news stories.  And if we can't identify all the functions, can an algorithm such as hers help (it would help ATT, clearly the big reason for the research).

	
  * Is there a 1-1 match between the marketing definition and a feature?

	
  * What empirical validation of the algorithm and architecture was done?  Probably hard to do, given the embryonic state of the field of IP telephony.

	
  * The feature box idea (and the pipe and filter architecture) is a good way to do evolution - just hook in a new feature box (however, this is evolution at the feature level, not the architecture level -- for example, say the IP Telephony standards change in the next year).

	
  * They do the programming with statecharts, using a custom langugage called BoxChart.
