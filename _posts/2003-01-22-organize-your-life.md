title: organize your life
---

Well, yesterday I realized (well, it has been a process of realization actually) that my thesis works have been really scattered. I would get to school and just flounder for a few hours trying to sort out what the hell needed doing and when. So today I broke down and spent the day trying to figure out a system of organization.

   1. admit you have a problem.
   2. whenever a thought occurs, I write it down somewhere rather than following it blindly and getting hopelessly off track.
   3. Peggy suggestion, which I think is a good one: write down the things to do for the next day as you leave the office/go to bed so that in the morning you have a good sense of what needs doing.
   4. I downloaded MS Project XP, project management software that we get free from the MSDNAA program. This software provides a good high-level view of what needs doing - what deadlines are coming soon. I think I will check in with this tool every week, but on Monday I plan to make a list (based on the project deadlines) what needs doing that week.

So, let us hope that helps somewhat.
