title: the West wants in!
---

Ok, first question: who is the West?  Anyone know?  From what I can tell, it's the largely rural, middle and upper class European-Canadians who vote for the current conservative party of the month.  The weird thing in Canadian elections is that our first-past-the-post system doesn't reflect very real differences in riding results.  For example, in my riding, [Saanich-Gulf Islands](http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=ele&document=59024&dir=38e/resval&lang=e&textonly=false), the Conservative candidate won with around 1/3 of the vote.  This means 2/3 of voters (most of whom, I think it can be safely said, are more left of centre) did not support him or his party.  Ok, I'll grant that in ridings in Western Canada (i.e. Manitoba west), some had overwhelming Conservative majorities, indicating clear support for that party.  However, to extrapolate purely from seat results and suggest that the West is strongly Conservative is a gross generalization and totally false.  The "West" doesn't exist in any sense of the word, it is, like all of Canada, an immensely diverse place that defies categorization.
