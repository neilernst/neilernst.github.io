title: tags useful?
---

Lots of hype about tagging and folksonomy lately.  Trouble is, I've never actually found them useful.  I throw lots of stuff into del.icio.us, but never used it much.  Google still works best.

However, with Gmail, I find I do use the 'tags' a lot; I suspect this is a holdover from using mail folders.  Also, my mail is not as searchable as web documents seem to be.  For example, with mail you must remember important key words in order to quickly separate wheat from chaff.  Say I want to know the address of a picnic site; I also have 30 other emails dealing with the terms picnic, computer science, the date, etc.  Thus locating it requires me to formulate a pretty specific query.  Tags work better for my style of searching; I just go to the appropriate tag and do a rough scan of the titles to locate the one I think I need.  This is essentially the same list as the search would return, but I'm nearly guaranteed that it's an exhaustive list (that is, some poor search terms didn't exclude potentially relevant results).  I would like to see the search form in Gmail include a slider for dates, like in Adobe Photoshop Elements.

My other concern with tags is related to the bottom-up vs. top-down debate.  Clay Shirky made a [convincing argument](http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html) that top-down directories, like Yahoo or the Library of Congress, push a pre-defined mental model on users.  Clearly, any externally produced work, be it a song, poem, essay, etc., in some sense reflects the creator's biases (well, actually this isn't obvious to a lot of people).  If I understand him correctly, he argues individual tagging schemes are more flexible and reflect one's own mental model of how {image, web page, reference} categorization ought to work.

Naturally -- this seems tautological.  The problem here is that it now becomes harder to share beyond one's own mental model -- you need to seek agreement with others on what, semi-exactly, a "rose" is - the person, the thing, or something else.  Not that it's always hard to do, but I don't find it easy to use del.icio.us to do this sort of thing.  I think the tag vs. predefined categories debate ignores that adopting either perspective tends to come with a set of omissions and advantages.

Here's a good quote I saw:



<blockquote>The litmus test for good classification is not "does it use tags?" but "does it help people find shit?" [1]</blockquote>
