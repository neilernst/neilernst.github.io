title: More Scriptingâ€¦
---

I've been looking at java scripting languages. The one our colleagues at UofA use is tcl blend. Another interesting one is Rhino, a javascript java script. haha. I'm still unclear on what all the advantages are of either. I read an interesting article at this site if you're interested. I prefer Rhino I think, simply because I'm familar with jscript and not tcl. Plus Rhino seems to have a better licence regime. Finally, the tcl site is a year old. Don't know what this implies. More later.
