title: Up and running at long last..
---

Well, after a painful few days attempting to reinstall XP, I'm back up and running.  I don't _think_ I lost much data, but time will tell.  Dave Manning (super helpful research programmer) installed TSM backup client on my PC and I hope that will alleviate future problems of this sort.

This week I've been marking and assisting with the Infoviz course.  There were some really interesting demos today, the MovieLens in particular being pretty interesting.  I liked Dave's work as well; the visualization is pretty neat but the coloring could perhaps use some work.

I'm experimenting with Algernon ([see here](http://smi.stanford.edu/people/hewett/research/ai/algernon/)) as a way of getting data out of Protege.  Tomorrow I will work on shrimp-bib, and possibly integrating that with this blog site.
