title: NoMeansNo - Give Me the Push
---

One of Victoria's longest-lasting punk bands. Later stuff has gotten more melodic and exploratory, but it's all good.

Today I continued preparations for the DesignCo tomorrow, including the all-critical step of locating Crayons. I have been reading the OWL Guide document, which lists all the OWL syntax using the Wines ontology as an example. I was also exploring using the Squish RDF/FOAF query tool but it was difficult to run on Windows, so I've turned to the JENA parser from HP Labs. I intend to use this to run the queries against the ontology I create.
