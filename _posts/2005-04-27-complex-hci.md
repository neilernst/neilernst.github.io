title: Complex HCI
---

Complex HCI is analysis of humans interacting with complex systems.  

<blockquote>For years, Human Factors research has been focusing on the interaction between the individual user and a computer-based system.  On the basis of this paradigm, considerable progress has been made in the design of human coputer interfaces.  The individualistic presupposition of this paradigm is obviously invalid, however.  Work is [an] inherently social phenomenon.  ([Schmidt, 1991, p.75](http://www.citeulike.org/user/neilernst/article/113171))</blockquote>





  * an ontology is one way of doing this


  * we might need tools to understand the initial tools: for example, requirements engineering is one approach to understanding a work domain, with an associated set of tools.  We may need tools to make sense of what the RE tools are suggesting is going on.  To illustrate, consider using think-aloud and interview techniques to elicit requirements.  Once we have those 'requirements', we need to understand them (as designers, even as users) and _i*_ for one, is a way of doing this.


  * cooperative work is different, in my mind.  CSCW is about a group cooperating on a project.  This is looking at the other end of Schmidt's analysis: the computer-based system.  I contend much of HCI deals with simple, non-distributed, non-complex systems.  The Mac.  Word.  Graphics applications.  Work is needed in HCI for autonomic systems, web services, intelligent agent systems, large ontologies, the Semantic Web.  How do we understand the ontological commitment being made?  How do we decide whether a service is going to do what it says it will?  Perhaps this isn't HCI so much as cognitive engineering, with HCI fitting into the design-time details, as it does in things like EID.
