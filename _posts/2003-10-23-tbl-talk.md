Next ISWC: Nov 7-11 Hiroshima, JPN  

[Talk: Tim Berners-Lee - Status and Direction of the SW](http://www.w3.org/2003/Talks/1023-iswc-tbl)


  * OWL much argued over, RDF bringing about a shift in people's thinking


  * simplicity absolutely essential, yet every layer has little bits of cruft  (products of compromise?)


  * some people just want an engineering solution, but we should still keep focused on the architecture ('constructive tensions')


  * Discusses RDF/XML syntax shock - people don't want engineers to use it


  * WS and SW stuff orthogonal for most of the time, except the DAML-S stuff
