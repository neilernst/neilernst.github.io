title: Scripting Java GUIs
---

Jelly is a tool that turns XML into executable code.  I gather this is like 'XMLScript' or something.  At any rate, they have method for using Jelly to build Swing GUIs in Java, without Java code.  See [here](http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/tutorial.html#jellyswing).  Only problem is, I've had a heck of a time installing this bugger on my computer.  I'll have some more tries later on.
