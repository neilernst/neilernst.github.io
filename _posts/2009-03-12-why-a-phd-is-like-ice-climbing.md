For a while, I've been following [Will Gadd's blog](http://gravsports.blogspot.com/). Will is a multi-talented adventurer, excelling in paragliding, kayaking, and ice climbing, among others. There's a great article about [him here](http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3920952).

After reading the article, and feeling a tinge of jealousy at his seemingly super-fun life, I realized that to some extent, my choice of career follows a similar trajectory. (Warning: navel-gazing ahead)

Many people think of academics as coddled and distanced from reality. The truth is quite different, at least for those of us with no seniority. In my lab are 10 people who are more accomplished in research than I am. They will all be looking for what amounts to maybe 3-4 job openings a year. And no one is in this for money, either -- I'd have chosen the civil service (my internship experience), or law, or banking, if money was the motivator. Almost all of us actively read the major industry blogs, like [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) or [Joel Spolsky](http://joelonsoftware.com) or [Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com). When an industry type says academics don't blog enough, I feel like pointing him to my posts from 2002.  We seek intensely to keep relevant, balancing that need with the demands of methodical and novel research.

Like an ice climb, we seek satisfaction in the accomplishment. Getting a paper accepted is like topping out on a major new climb. Having done it, we seek immediately for the next peak, or project. I haven't made a lot of money in my career, but I'm proud of how I've managed to 'not quit', and persevere despite falling off quite a few times.Â  A Ph.D., to me, is like a climb up a major mountain, like K2. It's a major expedition, which takes many years of planning. You need a good support team (thanks hon!), but ultimately, by the end, in the death zone (aka defence), it's up to you to work it all out. Both ice climbing and research are about challenging yourself (against others, too), to be better each day at what you do. It's a constant process of self-critical reflection, marked by occasional periods of external critique. You do it because you can, and because you want to say you've done it, and because when it's going good, nothing is better.

Ice climbing may be slightly more sexy.
