_FONTE - Staab and Campos_
Refactoring ontologies from more complex ones.  This is not a well-documented process and often quite difficult.  In particular, this method seems to separate an ontology into temporal and non-temporal to allow for easier recombination.  

_Task-Knowledge for Geo-Spatial Imagery - O'Sullivan, UC Dublin, p. 78_  

Eoin=Owen never knew that.  This presenter has a lovely Irish accent.  Talk is about the need for better annotation for geo-spatial image data. Trying to capture knowledge implicitly to separate UI from knowledge engineering.  Evaluation seems to be another case of testing whether the improvements improved the system; no domain experts or real user systems were involved, thus no way to conclude how useful this tool actually might be.  I do like the focus on making use of the user's expertise to capture the important information but I wonder how often people will make these annotations (except as part of the workflow).  Bootstrap problem.
