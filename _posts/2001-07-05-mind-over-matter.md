Today I tried a new thing, Yoga, which is always good, I realize. At first I was a little nervous about it, as I usually am with these things, but after a while, and with a friend to laugh with, I took to it quite readily. The instructor was easy-going, and well, instructive, which was the best way to learn about it. I wanted to try yoga both because of the interesting philosophical connotations (eastern mysticism) but primarily because, both naturally and after 2 years of  rowing, I am a very inflexible person, with lower back stiffness. The exercises we tried were quite simple (as I understand yoga anyway) but excellent at loosening muscles and relaxing the body. But more than that, what I appreciated was the way an hour of yoga can be such a great way to focus on something else, to forget whatever else is going on in your life. In the final 10 minute meditative stage, I felt more centered and relaxed than I had been in weeks.
