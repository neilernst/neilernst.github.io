Since my days as a GIS Specialist in the [BC Ministry of Environment](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca), I thought the governmental policy that required agencies to **sell** the public back its data was simple-minded and counter-productive. [Word today](http://www.news.gc.ca/cfmx/view/en/index.jsp?articleid=290039) is the Department of Natural Resources, a federal agency, will open-source their data sources via the aptly-named [GeoGratis](http://www.geogratis.cgdi.gc.ca/geogratis/en/index.html). I predict this will inspire some innovative geospatial applications, create value, and all that good stuff.

Now if only the provinces would all get onboard the cluetrain.
