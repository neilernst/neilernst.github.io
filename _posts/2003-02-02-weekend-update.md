title: Weekend update
---

Raced Monster Erg today, and pulled pretty well (6.43) considering the drastically lower amount of training I am doing (since the summer anyway). I am glad it is over til next year.

I am editing the FOAF schema to be acceptable to Protege. The Ugly Widget is showing up (interesting debugging method) and that is nae guid. Basically it comes down to Protege's RDF implementation being behind the times. I am eagerly looking forward to an update in this area.
