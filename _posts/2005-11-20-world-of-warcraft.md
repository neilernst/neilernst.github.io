title: World of Warcraft

The evil people at Blizzard had a special offer of 10 days of [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) for free. WoW is an online multiplayer game, a so-called MMORPG, with graphics essentially like a first-person shooter like Doom, but with other characters played by people around the world (well, Western world anyway).

  

Anyway, the game is a massive black hole for productivity, and even now I feel the pull of the 'full' version (the trial only allows you to get to level 10). It's fascinating to run around, see someone struggling to battle a wolf, and jump in and lend a few slashes of the dagger to help them out -- knowing that person is alive in meatspace somewhere 'out there'.

So it's a lot of fun. But also, beside that, I think it presages the vision of cyberspace that the technologies of Virtual Reality have thus far failed to deliver. You really do get a sense of being in a different world, albeit poorly realized in places (I can stand on tables and no one complains). I can see the improvements coming, too. After all, the underlying technology is all there -- just awaiting a little Moore's Law action to allow for even more realistic and interactive game play.

What could we do with this? I thought of two things, off the top of my head. One is to use this instead of Netmeeting software. You organize a virtual meeting in one of these worlds, 'book' a tavern room, get staffers around the table and discuss the latest on the Johnson project. I got the feeling that 'seeing' others in such a world is much more compelling than online chats, or emails. Plus, the lag factor (network slowdowns) is less significant as a lot of the processing is happening on the client-side. In videoconferencing, you have to share the entire picture. Here, I imagine, all that's being shared is relative positions, character movement, etc. Why do we need to see the 'exact' picture of someone's face? Isn't it enough to get a 'sense' of them as a person? In his talk, one of the graphics engineers at Pixar mentioned that the human face has around 60 independent 'controllers' for the face (muscles). If we can approach this in games like WoW, I think we can get closer to live interaction. In truth, I don't need to see the exact moment someone blinks, but rather, just that his avatar does blink, occasionally.

The second thing I thought about was using this for corporate retreats. If I was Blizzard, I would sell the right to use certain high-level characters for a short period of time. You get five or six people together, train a little on simple tasks, then get together and go on some particular quest, working together, using the various skills of the people in the party. You could probably charge hundreds of dollars for this sort of thing.

  
 Anyway, one week to go, and lots of work to avoid!
