title: Requirements and context
---

Greg Wilson describes [requirements-as-conversations](http://pyre.third-bit.com/blog/archives/000332.html), where the focus is less on the static specification, and more on the surrounding context for a given requirement.  He suggests data mining as a good means for extracting this context from emails, internal docs, and so on.

I think this approach is close in spirit to the CWA philosophy of focusing on the context of the work being done, rather than just the tasks that need to be completed. A reasonably competent developer/architect/engineer should be able to take such a collection of documents (a work domain analysis, for example) and then turn that into a working product.  Only when you approach NASA level complexity are detailed documents really necessary (only in complex sociotechnical systems?).

This is what I call "the really smart person effect", which means regardless of methodology (SCRUM, XP, RUP, etc), certain common jobs need to happen (facilitating, eliciting, designing, motivating, and so on).  I argue that the importance of these common jobs, when done by a smart, capable person, obscure the overlying methodology.  That is, if I take an excellent RUP program manager, and stick that person into an XP, agile project, that individual will still deliver good results.  Of course, just as it is important to use smart people, one needs healthy organizational support as well.  This corollary goes as follows: no matter which process is chosen, the disfunctional organization will still end up with bad results.  [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com) and others have discussed similar thoughts, but I can't track down a link right now.

This  touches on a thought I had recently, which is that no matter which methodology you choose, essentially the problem must go through the data acquisition phase, and that is always the bottleneck (much as it was/is in knowledge engineering).  At some point data about the domain, the processes, and the skills of the operators must be gathered.  A particular methodology can't get around this phenomenon (other than by bullshitting you); they just dress it in new clothes, e.g. XP (do it as we develop), RAD (let's all do it together) or RUP (let's do it by the book).
