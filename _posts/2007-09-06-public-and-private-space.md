An interesting story caught my attention this morning and prompted me to recall other similar issues. The [rugby world cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup) kicks off [September 7 in France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Rugby_World_Cup) (and I'll be going to one of the games, luckily!). I wouldn't say rugby is a major international event, certainly not on the order of soccer/football or the Olympics. And yet, the rugby organizers are [insisting on media restrictions](http://www.globesports.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070906.wsptrugb6/CommentStory/GlobeSportsOther/home) before accrediting journalists. These restrictions include the number of photos that can be posted, the length of video highlights, and so on. For example, I suspect it would be illegal for me to take a Blackberry to the game and post updates to Twitter about the action. To their credit, major agencies like Reuters are balking at the idea of these restrictions.

So who 'owns' the footage? Clearly, the television companies are the ones creating the reproduction, but the rugby board is organizing the tournament, has encouraged participation, provides camera access, etc. The stadiums are probably private, so the owners have the right to restrict access.Â  Presumably those restrictions can include restrictions on freedom of speech, from [racist banners](http://www.farenet.org/) to [live updates](http://scholarsandrogues.wordpress.com/2007/06/12/blogging-a-sports-event-whats-live-and-what-isnt/).

The question relates back to a more fundamental one, in my mind. That would be the relationship between private and public space. For example, if you sit in a condo beside the Rogers Centre in Toronto, you have a reasonable chance of recording the action in the game - hits, pitches, etc. But if you tried to publish those stats, I wager the baseball people would [crack down on you](http://puckstopshere.blogspot.com/2006/01/mlb-statistics-ownership-and-fantasy.html), because they make a lot of money selling that very thing -- or at least, the personas and interest professional players engender. And yet, you are just watching something happening outside, where people can fairly easily see it.

In a similar vein, a [famous sculpture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_Gate) in Chicago -- prominently displayed outdoors, on a public plaza, but commissioned privately and gifted to the city -- attempted to [prohibit people](http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/06/chicagos-public-scul.html) from taking photos of it and then commercializing them (the artist holds the copyright). Again, though, this is a public space, where everyone who wishes to can walk up to the sculpture and photograph it. Indeed, a majority of the artistic value of this piece is the public location, because it reflects the Chicago skyline. In other words, the public is contributing the location, while the artist contributes the vision. If you were to make a postcard series about Toronto, for example, you would include the CN tower, the waterfront, the skyline. As citizens and residents, our representatives have clearly decided that the economic activity from producing such things is more beneficial than the rights fees 'copyrighting' various outdoor structures might garner.

Celebrities have no right to make money off their public images (much to their chagrin, I'm sure). And yet they work as hard as anyone at enhancing their image, cultivating a personality, spending hours in the gym (or washroom). People don't have a right when they are in a public space to prevent photos being taken of them (subject to harassment, stalking, etc.). The celebrity benefits anyway, of course -- more exposure, more notoriety, bigger paychecks.

In a world where digital, flawless reproduction is incredibly easy -- soon my personal phone will be able to capture good quality, streaming video of a rugby game -- society needs to decide where the line between [public and private](http://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2007/07/10/SportsBloggers/) should be drawn. If a developer builds a subdivision, who 'owns' the roads? Can access be restricted? If you build a mall on top of an existing public thoroughfare, should you be allowed to restrict access to certain groups, like the homeless, or vagrants, or ...? Why should someone get to 'own' a lake?

I think the big concern has to be the way our economic system assigns value to something only if it can be monetized. The fact Ontario has a vast northern boreal forest is economically worthless -- so any 'use' of that area is seen as valuable. Protecting public space near waterfront has no extrinsic value, other than vague notions of 'quality of life' or 'goodwill' -- and yet I bet most people would be in favour of such restrictions.

To my mind, that is what environmentalism and socialism are about. Proper valuation is at the heart of struggles like that over logging in [Clayoquot Sound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayoquot_Sound), [pipelines in the Mackenzie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Valley_Pipeline), and saving endangered species. In the same way, one's right to describe objects one sees in public spaces, while economically difficult to value, are no less important.
