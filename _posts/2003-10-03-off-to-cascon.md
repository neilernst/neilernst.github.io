title: Off to CASCON
---

Tomorrow it's off to Toronto for [CASCON](http://cas.ibm.com/cascon).  Del, Ian, Liz, Peggy, and I are going for a week to show off the latest and greatest CHISEL technology.  Ian and I will demo/display something I rather tiredly termed "Shrimp dishes": Creole, Jambalaya, Ebi, and Xia.  I'm also going to three workshops: aspect-oriented development, UCD methodologies, and Automated Reasoning.  Friday I'll be at [UofT](http://www.utoronto.ca/) to talk with prospective grad supervisors for a Ph.D., and then I'm going to Ottawa to visit my brother Tomas for Thanksgiving.   Oh yeah, I'll also be working on my thesis the whole time too!  :-O
