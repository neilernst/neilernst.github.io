title: CVS client
---

I came across [SmartCVS](http://www.smartcvs.com/) the other day, which seems to be a much improved client for CVS.  Previously I used TortoiseCVS but it was a pain, sometimes, as it was all context-driven.  The SmartCVS client is pretty slick and usable.  Not open-source, regrettably, but I guess I only care about that if the program works.

Next step is to try Subversion, I think, but that can wait.  CVS, for my purposes (basically file transfer from work to home) is just fine.
