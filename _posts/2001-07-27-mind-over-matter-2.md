title: Mind over Matter 2
---

Ca we train our mnds to see beyond the everyday? For instance, while doing yoga tonight, in Savasana pose, a relaxed lying position with eyes closed, I focused on visualizing nothing but a single candle in my mind. This, for me anyway, was extremely difficult to get correct, although I achieved it for a minute. Surely repeated concentration can be used to train one's mind to hold a focus longer and longer, as is done in some eastern religions. But to me this brings up the question of what people see when they say that word. For instance, a hallucination warps what we perceive as reality, but the nature of the transformation is uncertain. Is the hallucination something we have inside our psyches, or is it a simpler, low-level alteration? Is it possible for some people to 'see' inside their souls or the souls of others?
