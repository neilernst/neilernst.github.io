This post initially was going to be commenting on a recent report on requirements and business analysis. However, along the way I came to read up more on the 'CHAOS' reports, and a fascinating discussion about their methodology (and business model), which I think ties in directly with the latest report.

The new report is from [IAG](http://www.iag.biz/), a company that sells requirements consulting services. They released [a technical whitepaper](http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/242329b68e7667a9894629c1dbf843ba4/neilernst) on requirements use in business. Titled "The Impact of Business Requirements on the Success of Technology Projects", the report concludes that 68% of companies will have their projects fail due to bad requirements practices.

This is a company with a vested interest in these results (it's akin to Merck reporting on a new painkiller). As with most of these reports, such as the [Standish CHAOS report](https://secure.standishgroup.com/reports/reports.php), there is no methodology writeup, the participants are unidentified, and there is no assessment of validity and reliability.

They mention a survey of over 100 enterprises, with business application projects costing(?) over $250k. The survey instrument is not available publicly. As a result, the report is replete with statistics and numbers of unknown origin. For example, "over 70% of companies in the upper third of requirements discovery capability reported having a successful project". What is the upper third of 'requirements discovery capability'? How is membership assessed? What is a successful project? The rest of the report, it seems to me, can be summed up thusly: "companies that use our Requirements Discovery Processâ„¢deliver better projects on-time and under-budget". Hardly surprising.
