title: Why didn't a researcher come up with Agile Software Development?

Pursuant to <jorge's post> <greg's question> and more generally <research impact>.

Agile Software Development is generally thought to start from the posting of the Agile Manifesto. The main signatories:

Of those people (all men, but that's for another time ...) how many were 'academics' in the sense that they have *at some time* held a post as a faculty member? I don't list faculty appointments, since I am more interested in the formative years of their lives, not whether they at some point were adjunct faculty (I imagine any university would love to have one of these men on their payroll .. or maybe I'm wrong).

Reasons: they were more exposed to the problems in the field (no excuse ...), they had a vested interest in selling new paradigms.

Researchers take a meta-view. They work at the early part of the problem, the abstract part. Not, "how many rivets do we need on this wing" but "What type of wing?" "what type of foil" "what are the fluid dynamics of the air over the wing?". Not that the rivet problem isn't a hard one.

My research has contributed a solid definition of what the problem is (I would argue we still don't have a good sense of this in the Agile manifesto, which is so generic "People over Process" and motherhood).It formalizes the problem because formality allows the ugliness to show through.
