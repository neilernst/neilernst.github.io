No New Year's Resolutions (well, finish my PhD, but that was also last year's :)). However, moving my email around brought to light one of my favorite messages, from my undergrad (UVic Vikes) rowing coach, Will Dodds:


<blockquote>There are four important things in life:
1.  Family
2.  School work (if you are in school)
3.  Gettin' some!
4.  VIKES Rowing

Thanks for a great day!

I miss the simplicity of athletics, where each day was about squeezing out a little more speed. And that was it. You got up, you ate a bagel, you hit the water, you pulled hard. I've done 3 and 4, I'm about to embark on #1, and #2 is more of a life journey, it would seem. But the same lessons apply in school as in rowing. It's a funny coincidence (or _Ironic_) that in both rowing and computer science I've come late to the party - no undergrad in Computer Science, no high school rowing career. In both I've felt outside the system to some extent. And in both I've had setbacks, but also moments of excitement.
