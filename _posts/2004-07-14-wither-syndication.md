title: Wither Syndication
---

Syndication is often described by pundits as the 'next Web', a revolution that will alter how we interact with the world.  Blogging, for example, will deliver democratic, personalized content to anyone who subscribes.  It has certainly saved me a lot of time surfing websites every day -- now I can get the content I'm interested in delivered to me, in byte-sized pieces from which I can choose the most relevant (to me!) bits.  But what is its long-term future?

Where is RSS porn, for example?  In examining my own server logs, the bandwidth demands, even for a relatively unpopular site (non-popular?) such as this, quickly get pretty steep.  Who will pay for the bills the NYT, for example, must have?  Those eyeballs are skipping a lot of the site.  Now, true, most sites only deliver a teaser, not the entire content, but if so, hasn't that defeated, by and large, the mandate of 'syndication'?
