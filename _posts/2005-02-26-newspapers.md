I'm thinking of stopping the [paper](http://globeandmail.com) for a while.  The weekend version has two faults that are affecting me.  One, the non-news sections (like Arts, Style, Travel, Homes) are essentially paeans to consumption and the NorthAmerican, middle-class lifestyle.  As someone earning less than $25k a year, these articles are meaningless and frustrating.  I can't own a house in this area, not for a while, and I find the homes section to implicitly condemn you for not being able to afford a home that is $400k or so.  The implied tone is, "Why can't you buy this nice dress"  or "You should dine here at this $120 p.p restaurant".

Now, I like the finer things in life as much as anyone, but I don't need to be constantly reminded of how I can't afford them.

I mentioned two faults.  The second is the constant profusion of negative news the paper seems to contain.  I don't even mean the stories of famine in Africa, or violence in the middle East.  I'm growing more annoyed at the paper's columns on wrongdoings in the local area, or seemingly obvious political decisions not made.  I'm tired of reacting to everything I read.  I think that's why people prefer entertainment and sports - there, nothing is objectionable, at least not at first glance.  The stories are harmless and mindless.

But I do need something to occupy me during the morning feeding.
