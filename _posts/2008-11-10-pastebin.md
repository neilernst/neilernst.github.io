Various code snippets I've found useful:

Mysql import:

    
    mysql -p -h DBSERVER dbname < dbname.sql 



`reset`
Restore a screwed-up terminal (a terminal showing funny characters) to default setting. Use if you tried to "cat" a binary file. You may not be able to see the command as you type it.  Yes, I just figured this out ... beats just closing the term every time.

`sed -n '5,10p' perio.xml`
Extract lines 5-10 from file perio.xml and print to stdout.

`df -hT`
Show filesystems and mount points in Linux
