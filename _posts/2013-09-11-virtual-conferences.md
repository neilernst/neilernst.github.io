[Virtual Conferences](http://tagide.com/blog/2013/09/the-future-of-conferences/)

The virtual conference has many benefits in terms of GHG emission reductions, cost savings, and accessibility. Jon Pipitone and Jorge Aranda co-organized a [very small event](http://ccasr11.wordpress.com/) with me in 2011 around climate change and software. We used Skype and instant messaging to connect climate researchers with software researchers, but my feeling afterwards was that virtual worlds like OpenSim were the way to go. 

It's cool to see [Crista Lopes](http://tagide.com/about.html) has managed a relatively large-scale event.
