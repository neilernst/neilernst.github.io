title: Key Stages in a Dissertation - Part 1
---

I'm attempting to set down for myself the parts of the dissertation that truly are milestones.



### Preparing the evaluation


Personally, I feel this is perhaps the most important part of one's research.  It's at this juncture that irreversible (without a lot of effort anyway) moves are made to set up the evaluation of the idea.  If this is poorly designed or insufficient effort is devoted to it (and it is often a less-exciting part of the research), in 3-6 months you'll be writing the actual dissertation and thinking, 	"Shoot, I should have done more!"  The evaluation is what everyone is looking for, as well, and is to me the actual 'Science-y' part of the process - you've posed a theory, and now you try to convince others of its accuracy, or, at the least, that your theory is testable.
