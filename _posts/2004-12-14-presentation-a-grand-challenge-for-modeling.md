title: 'Presentation:  a grand challenge for modeling'
---

[David Harel](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/) gave a presentation for the U of T CS department today which was very interesting.  Harel is one of the inventors/originators of statecharts in software engineering.  His current work is concerned with large-scale modeling of 'reactive' systems - reactive meaning respond to stimuli.  He is currently spearheading a project which aims to build a complete, four-dimensional model of _[C. elegans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans)_, a fairly simple lifeform which has nonetheless fairly similar abilities to some human functions.
