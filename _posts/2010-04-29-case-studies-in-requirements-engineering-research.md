I maintain (occasionally) a list of common case studies in the RE literature. These are extended examples or model problems, really, which can be used to compare various formalisms. I have links to the data and academic literature.

A common complaint in reviewing research papers is lack of real-world evaluation. But before we get to the thousands of requirements common in industry, we ought to also verify our approach with frequently used examples from the existing literature. I feel that 'real-world' is a substitute for voluminous; but often the problem is not (just) the sheer scale, but the interesting edge cases. For that job, I prefer we evaluate our work on smaller, easily understandable model problems.
