_This is part of the [MSR Challenge](http://www.neilernst.net/archives/tag/msr/) series._

In the midst of my work on the project, I've just reported on the details. Here's the overview.

The [MSR workshop](http://msr.uwaterloo.ca/msr2009/index.html) is a heavily empirical software engineering conference focused on open-source software repositories. A repository typically contains some or all of the following: source code with revisions; mailing lists; bug trackers; websites; user information; etc. Most of MSR is concerned with the source code, but that's not (for me) necessarily the most interesting.

In the past 10-15 years, these data sources have grown tremendously, giving us a good opportunity to work with real-world data. Of course, these projects are not representative of the industrial, closed-source world, or rather, we don't have a good handle on how representative they are.

As an aside, it's high time someone constructed a software ecosystem guide, because comparing SAP implementations to Gnome music players is meaningless in almost any context I can think of. That's not to say the open-source code is lower quality; on the contrary, I suspect they may be higher quality than your average corporate website written in VB/ASP.

Every MSR workshop has a challenge component; [this year's challenge](http://msr.uwaterloo.ca/msr2009/challenge/index.html) is to use projects hosted at Gnome.org as the dataset. There are two challenges: 1) predict growth of Gnome projects (following various theories of software evolution and using different predictive models); 2) report on something 'interesting' learned from (all or a subset of) these sources.

I've chosen the second challenge, and my next post will go into more detail about the 'interesting' thing I hope to uncover. Part of my motivation is to help my own reasoning; the other part is to document the methodology I use for the report.

This series is me blogging my way through the project. The due date is March, so I expect to be reporting at odd intervals until then. And if all goes well, look for me in Vancouver in May!
