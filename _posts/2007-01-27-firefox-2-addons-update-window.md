title: Firefox 2 addons update window
---

Firefox is pretty cool. It even checks for updated plugins before launch. The silly thing is, if it finds an update, it asks the user if it should be installed - well, I guess you may not want an update.  If you then click on "install", it does its thing, then when finished, requires you to press "continue" - with no other alternative (perhaps you can exit via the close button). This seems like poor UI design as I often hit "install", go off and do something else, then search for the new Firefox window -
which is still hung up waiting for me!
