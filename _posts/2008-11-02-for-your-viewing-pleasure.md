Two must-sees, one on the screen and one on the stage.



	
  1. [Mongol](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0416044/): I would call this a cowboy movie set in 12th century Mongolia. It's a little bit love story, a little bit vengeance tale, a little bit epic, all set in gorgeous landscapes and filmed on location. Best of all, the Mongolians actually are Mongolian (with a few exceptions). I saw it on the small screen, but I would highly recommend the movie theatre.

	
  2. [Raisin in the Sun](http://http://www.soulpepper.ca/performances/08_season/a_raisin_in_the_sun.aspx): A play about hopes and disappointments. And race. And abortion. And women's rights. Like all great plays, truly timeless. I thought the actors in this play were some of the strongest I'd seen at Soulpepper (or anywhere, for that matter). The themes in the play are even more poignant given the possible election of Barack Obama on November 4th.


BTW, Soulpepper has 13$ student tickets, which, apart from the longish TTC commute, gives one no reason not to go.
