title: PostgresQL frustration
---

Well, I spent a lot of today working on the Drupal installation. Still not much luck on this front as I really don't know how the Drupal people say they support Postgres given the amount and severity of errors I've seen so far. I have to do the paper tomorrow as well as race the 1x in the morning - lots going on again!
