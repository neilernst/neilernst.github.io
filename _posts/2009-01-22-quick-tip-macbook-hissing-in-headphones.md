When I first started to listen to music with headphones on my Macbook Pro, I would get an annoying hiss and static sound during dead air. After googling around for a fix, it seems to be something to do with the inherent resistance (as in Ohms) of the headphones. Fortunately, there was a simple fix: with my JVC headphones, there is a volume control, which seems to be adjusting the resistance on the fly. At any rate, lowering the volume control 'magically' eliminates the hiss completely.
