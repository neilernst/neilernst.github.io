title: First Day of Meetings
---

Today was pretty good, first day at the NCICB. First thing was a meeting with Frank Hartel, chief of the EVS program. He described a bit of info on what he hoped to see from Jambalaya and Protege. Frankly it sounded a bit ambitious to me but I'm sure that's just a 'bargaining position'. Then I went to talk with Peter Covitz, the head of the caBio project. He showed off 'BioGopher' the renamed myCaBio site. It looks really neat, complete with SVG-enabled pathway diagrams and the ability to query the datasets with a spreadsheet (e.g. thousands of matches at a time). He put the focus more on us doing neat visualizations than on making a user-centered tool (?!).

After that I interviewed (contextual interview, of a sort) four modellers on the EVS. I mic'ed them and have an hour and a half of tape to go over now. It was very interesting to see them working and gave me (finally) an idea about what a knowledge engineer does. 'Til tomorrow Dear Diary.
