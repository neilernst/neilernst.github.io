title: After class...
---

Well I finished my teaching today.  The class went quite well,  Jeff in particular gave a very good discussion showing the intersection of research and industry in information visualization and web development.  My talk was good but I think needed a little more focus on the visualization aspects.  I think the last exercise, drawing a map, was quite productive for most of the students.  There were some excellent examples shown as well.  I wish that I had a little more continuity, to develop a series of lectures that would be tied together in a more obvious thematic ribbon >)
I'm working on the old Infovis paper today and tomorrow, as well as redoing my ACSE paper.
