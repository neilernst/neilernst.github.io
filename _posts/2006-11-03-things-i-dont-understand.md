title: Things I don’t understand
---

I moved to the University of Toronto in 2004 for my Ph.D.  I'm somewhat of an exerciser, so I sussed out the gym situation. Part of my 500$ or so in fees includes, in point of fact, **two **gyms. Hmm, two. Ok, maybe one is in Scarborough or Mississauga.

No.  It seems, for some quirk of history I suppose, that there is one gym at the Athletic Centre, some 530m from my office. Then there is another gym at Hart House, something like a student centre. It's about  600m away, depending on field crossings. The weird thing is while both offer similar features -- pool, jogging track, ergs, weights, fitness classes -- they differ in strange ways.

For example, the AC offers a free towel service. But no locks. Hart House offers locks but no towels (unless you pay). Also, Hart House offers soap dispensers in the shower, while the AC does not. The AC, run by the PE and sports departments, have old, crappy ergs, while Hart House has the brand new, Model D ergs. Wouldn't the rowing team use the AC? I remain puzzled by this.

The annoying thing is I pay fees to both places, and I have no say in the matter.
