The subjunctive case, which has nearly died out in English, is used to express desire in speech. For example, "The Green party should win" is a subjunctive sentence but uses the word 'should' to indicate the desire of the speaker. Other languages use verb endings to convey the same meaning. For example, in German:

**gehen** to go (infinitive)
**ging** went (imperfect, simple past)
**ginge** would go/gone (Subjunctive II)  (courtesy http://german.about.com/library/blsubjun2.htm)

And French:
aller
... que je (j') aille

This is of interest to me because goal modeling is a process of establishing both established facts (the indicative mood) as well as what should or ought to happen (the optative mood). Clearly goal modelers in Germany and France need to know their subjunctive quite well (I think I slept through this part of French 12).

In some ways I see English and i* taking similar approaches to conversation and meaning. By that I mean both are quite flexible in terms of syntax: one can do whatever one wants, to a greater extent than other languages. We depend on the modeler and the client to determine the context for the model in i* (e.g., to distinguish between what is and what ought to be), while English similarly relies on speakers to contextualize parts of speech that other languages, like German, require special tenses and verb endings for.Â  The difficulty arises when someone who is not familiar with the context must interpret the model or dialog.
