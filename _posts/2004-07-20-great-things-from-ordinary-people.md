title: Great things from ordinary people
---

This post was prompted by the stimulating series of posts that Michael Nielsen has been making about [effective research](http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/2004_07.html).  One post mentions the importance of altering a research environment to suit oneself.  Often 'ordinary' people, such as undergrads and grads, junior faculty, new hires, etc., can make big contributions.  Indeed, I'd venture that this is usually the way things happen.  The thing distinguishing the workshop a grad organizes from one a senior prof organizes is that the junior organizer has more work to do and less experience to draw on.  But it can certainly be done.  One of my revelations as a grad student was the fact that workshops were not just magically part of a program at a conference, but rather a produc of someone -- someone like me -- who put a lot of work in.
