Recently Piotr Kaminski [posted](http://www.ideanest.com/blog/item/16) about [IBM's WebFountain](http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/publicfeature/jan04/0104comp1.html) initiative.  He claims that if it works half as well as is claimed, the Semantic Web "is as good as dead".  I respectfully disagree.
