title: Political blogging is dead
---

There was a lot of talk in the last U.S. election about how independent bloggers (independent from the traditional media) managed to affect the course of the campaign - e.g., the SwiftBoat non-story.  Here in Canada, there's been no such big scandal -- the sponsorship affair was investigated by the very party it damaged.  Instead, we have many bloggers engaged in partisan sniping and poll-posting, usually with cursory analysis of how that poll reflects [the swing to X.](http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/election.htm) There are a few major pundits - [Paul Wells](http://weblogs.macleans.ca/paulwells/), [Andrew Coyne](http://andrewcoyne.com/), [Dan Cook](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051109.wdancookblog/BNStory/National/?page=rss&id=RTGAM.20051109.wdancookblog) - who, although they hold down journalism jobs in the regular world, come election time are transformed into senior analysts.

Let's debunk this notion.  Nothing qualifies anyone to become a commentator.  All you need is a good turn of phrase, the ability to write quickly, and a strong set of opinions.  Many people possess these traits -- well, the ability to write well is less common -- and sadly, that is what the blog world is in reality -- kinda like [Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park](http://www.speakerscorner.net/), except everyone is talking at once.

The real reason for this cacophony of commentary is that it's way too easy to post.  Even people who should know better, like the three mentioned above, find it necessary to write 2 or 3 times a day.  Let's assume that a good columnist has a good idea (for a column) each week.  And perhaps, in an election period, that increases to 2 a week (due to the increased activity in the country). What do you have to write about 2 or 3 times a day? Well, it's usually something which seemed clever at the time, or a bunch of polls which don't say anything new, or some cute photo of your ideological enemies...

I'm also annoyed with the tendency of commentary to, at best, selectively include facts that support the argument.  I'm sorry, but if you wish to convince me, you'll have to include potential counter-arguments and dismiss them rationally.  Some of the columns on various campaign issues in the Toronto Star have been very interesting, and informative, but don't really expand on their ideas, trailing off instead to pleas for support.  I find these columns intellectually dishonest. Christopher Hitchens said it best, in a recent review: "The first requirement of anyone engaging in an intellectual or academic debate is that he or she be able to give a proper account of the opposing position(s)".
