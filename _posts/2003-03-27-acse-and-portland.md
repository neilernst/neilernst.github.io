title: ACSE and Portland
---

Submitted the ACSE paper final copy yesterday, so looks like I'll be heading down to Portland in May.  Should be nice down there (Portland has GREAT microbreweries).
Today I created some output styles for EndNote to allow us to export our Endnote data into Shrimpbib/RDF format.  I think this could be really handy to visualize; the trick is tying them together via topics and ratings.
I also worked a little on slots and facets in Protege, based on a question Rob had.  We think reification is the best approach to take - and it's easier than it sounds.
