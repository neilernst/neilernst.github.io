A short entry to keep things posted.  Good meetings today, lots and lots of good ideas and things to do - so little time though!  This site needs better explanation for people as well, I think it will convince them but it may take a while until they get into it.  Still misinformation out there.

To do:
check if you can make a blog private in Drupal (only show it to yourself when logged in)
integrate Drupal taxonomy with shrimpbib automatically
provide a way of annotating a posting with a shrimp bib entry (e.g. see this URL : Shrimpbib#45 for the related paper) and vice versa.
be kinder to animals!  bleH :p
