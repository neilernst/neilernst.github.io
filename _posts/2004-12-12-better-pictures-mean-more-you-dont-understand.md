title: Better pictures mean more you donâ€™t understand

There's an interesting article up from the New Yorker on, among other things, [breast cancer screening](http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?041213fa_fact).  The author, [Malcolm Gladwell](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/qid=1102903065/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/702-6334210-4864844), makes the case that although we have ever-increasing resolution in our data, and the things we do with the data are likewise more sophisticated, most of the ways we try to understand the data have failed to keep pace.

In the specific case of breast cancer, there are numerous things in a mammogram that are either unknown or require an almost artistic ability to interpret correctly.  And various studies have shown that there is little consensus among radiologists on what a particular anomaly is.  Furthermore, science often doesn't know whether a potential tumour might be fatal or not.  And finally, it would seem that, at least in some cases, a well-trained examiner can manually detect cancers better than the images can.
