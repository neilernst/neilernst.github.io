title: More and More Rain
---

Went rowing today (I do this M,T,R,S at 5.30) and it was WET. I don't mind a warm rain, but this one was pretty cold and on top of it all, the wind was howling at times blustering against my back. Still, it's a good sport, challenging and invigorating.

As for today at work, I spent the morning typing like mad (I'm quite productive when I need to be!) finishing a comparative work assessment for our belated NASA proposal. It details other tools available for use in the field of ontology based metadata interchange. This will be quite useful for my thesis as well I should hope.
The rest of the day was spent in meetings. We had a great session on reinvigorating the SHriMP GUI, and Peggy's nephew Jonathan did an excellent job with heuristic walkthroughs of the system. I think we've all gotten much too close to the system to be all that objective. We have a lot of work ahead of us (especially important will be the notion of metrics I think) but this is and will be one great tool. It's interesting to reflect on how our research group differs from others. My sense is that unlike some groups, we seem to have a large central project to work on, and the results of our combined efforts have made a really great tool.
Tomorrow it's scripting time and time to think more about the 581 project.
