Microsoft Research Cambridge sponsored a [workshop on science in 2020](http://research.microsoft.com/towards2020science/background_overview.htm). Participants included physicists and biologists, among others. The results were published in a [special issue of _Nature_](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7083/index.html), and suggest that computing will play an increasingly important role in modeling and simulation of scientific experiments as a "formal framework and exploratory apparatus" for science in general. There is a [CFP related to models](http://research.microsoft.com/ero/csp/cfp2006.aspx) and prediction in biology and earth sciences.

This is very topical for me, clearly, as the areas of modeling and information management are core research philosophies of mine.

UPDATE: They are also incredibly fast at delivering the full-colour report they arrived at.
