title: Presentation and Paper Done

Finished the ACSE paper and submitted it. Pretty happy with it but I think there are 2 separate themes that could be identified. One, the major theme (major key?) is adoption-centric knowledge engineering, and why there is and will be a need for user-centered design of these tools with the emergence of Semantic Web technologies. The other theme (minor key? see GEB) is the cognitive support issues for knowledge engineering tools, and the similarity to software engineering tools (should read Andrew W. 's thesis for ideas here). I have changed focuse slightly to look more closely at cognitive support for knowledge engineering. This will be more difficult than designing (what would have been) somewhat trite metrics for ontologies, the hackneyed effect coming from the lack of any understanding as to what tools knowledge engineers lack. I would like to bring some of the research into this area from SENG and move it where possible to KE tasks. To do this, I'm beginning to read more on qualitative analysis techniques. In particular, I think an ethnographic approach is likely to be most successful; the consequence to this may be that the research might be dismissed as 'unscientific' by more post-positivist (?) scientists. Part of the struggle is to overcome what I perceive as a real lack of understanding over these other approaches to research, the perception of them as unscientific hand-holding. To address this my methodology section will have to be rock-solid.

I also presented to the group on my trip to DC. I fear it was somewhat slow for some people not working in the area, but there seemed to be so much to cover, and so many different things to discuss. I look forward to focusing the research more in the immediate future.
