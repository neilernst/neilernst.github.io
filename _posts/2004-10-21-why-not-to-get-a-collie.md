title: Why not to get a collie
---

So we're walking home the other night with Pierre, my wife's family Shih-Tzu, and this collie, about 50 metres ahead of us, suddenly falls to the ground looking at Pierre.  His owner holds the leash in disgust.  Collie is intent on Pierre and is heedless of his owner's prodding.  As we pass them, the owner says, "It's ridiculous, he thinks everything with four legs is a sheep!".  Pierre, however, refused to be herded.
