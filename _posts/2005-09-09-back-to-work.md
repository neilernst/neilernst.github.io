title: Back to work
---

Well, after a nice trip through the West Coast, I'm back to work.  This semester I will be TAing for the Software Carpentry and 494 projects, providing support for the Argon/DrProject installs.  I'm also helping with a workshop at CASCON on blogging, (Oct 17-18), and preparing for my depth oral in early November.  Finally I am trying to conclude my 2106 project this term as well.  Whew.
