_Aside: must fix these taxonomy terms_.

Had a productive day.  The new database from Jill worked successfully, and I have a working version of CVS drupal running.  It's very nice, the admin menus are much better.  Some small bugs but I think next week I can try again to transition the data here over to the new version.

Met with Peggy.  I need to start becoming more serious about writing and reading for the thesis.  I think a September date is unrealistic, and I'm probably looking at October or so.  I am excited about this topic though.  Like in Dave's case, where there is a **void** of information where no one has addressed the issue of non-structural arcs, in my case too I think the adoption issues in knowledge engineering are vast and relatively untouched.  So it's cool to be working on a topic where you are one of the first.

My big picture, of significant contributions I can make, relates to the issue of machine-understandable data.  I think machines (computers, handhelds, things I can't conceive) are rapidly becoming "sewn into" our lives in ways we haven't imagined.  But they require some way to ensure interoperability, and that's where I'd like to focus.  That, and tying this effort into making human-centered applications, something for everyone.
