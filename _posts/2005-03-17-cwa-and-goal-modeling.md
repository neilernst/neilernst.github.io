title: CWA and Goal Modeling
---

[i*](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/km/istar) is a theoretical framework for modeling non-functional requirements (decision criteria in strategy selection?) in software systems.  This paper will examine how i* notions of actors, goals, dependencies and softgoals correspond to equivalent constructs in CWA.  Where such correspondences don't exist, I examine why this is, and suggest some possible mappings, as appropriate.  Finally, I conclude with some thoughts on applications of an integrated software-based work analysis framework.

Questions:


	
  * What is the connection between i* concepts, organization modeling techniques, and CWA?
	
  * How does the notion of 'goal' that occurs often in requirements engineering map onto CWA components (clearly in the notion that each 'Actor' has a Goal).
	
  * How does the i* framework handle the notion of dynamic goals?
	
  * Where do the 'goals' a worker considers when making decisions at the Knowledge-Based Behaviour level come from?  Can we use i* to define these?
  * Where/when is it appropriate to leverage software requirements techniques and CWA
