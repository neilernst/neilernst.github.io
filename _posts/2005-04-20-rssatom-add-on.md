Is there a way to filter RSS feeds?  For example, I don't own OSX and really don't want to read about the nifty apps people install on it, etc.  I think it would be cool if you could pre-filter RSS feeds to remove items with keywords in the body.  This is almost the same thing as email filtering, I suppose, but it would cut down the number of unrelated posts I might see.
