<blockquote>We consistently discount mental transaction costs at a furious rate</blockquote>


when referring to the vi-like interface of Google's GMail service (j,k keys move around etc).  I think what he is getting at is that in learning to use these interfaces, we rely heavily on our ability to remember the key-strokes, maneuvers etc in memory, but perhaps this requirement has a hidden cost - the inability to remember a phone number, maybe.
