It's not that it isn't cool, or handy. I get that. I'm into technology, I like new shiny things. But I can't see the value of the iPhone for someone who isn't traveling a lot. First off, it's a phone, capabilities which are easy to find elsewhere -- other mobile phones or even a *gasp* landline. And I gather it isn't even that good a phone.

But secondly, it has these 'apps' the value of which I confess to not understanding. Ok, I can check movie times, I can keep a list of todo items, I have access to my contacts ... but I get all that on the web or laptop anyway. Why would I pay extra -- what is it, like 40$ a month for data -- just to have access to the web for the 20 minutes a day I don't have a computer open? I accept that not everyone has a laptop in front of them as much as I do, of course.

Finally, at this point in my life I am trying to NOT be online as much. I get the feeling my main use for an iPhone or Blackberry would just be to kill time or surf the web. Not things I need to be doing more of (this piece bears witness to that!).

BTW my current phone is a [Motorola V66](http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=18) (c. 2001). But it's a little hard to type SMS messages on a phone that clearly never anticipated that being a the major use for cell phones.
