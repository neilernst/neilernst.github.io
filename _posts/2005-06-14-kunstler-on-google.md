title: Kunstler on Google

I've been uneasy with [Google's](http://www.google.com) [lofty valuations](http://ca.moneycentral.msn.com/investor/quotes/quotes.asp?Symbol=US%3AGOOG) for some time (P/E of 112.50, target around $300);  James Howard Kunstler [sums up why](http://jameshowardkunstler.typepad.com/clusterfuck_nation/2005/06/californiathetr.html): 

<blockquote>[Google is just] a massive web-based advertising scheme -- because it is finally clear that all this talk about "connectivity" just leads to more commercial shilling, shucking, jiving, and generally fucking with your headspace in the interstices of whatever purposeful activity one may be struggling to enact on the internet.</blockquote>


Capitalism perverts everything.  Unless you define making profits to be perversion.  But the original aesthetic that was that beautiful, brilliant website of 1999 or so will soon be lost forever.
