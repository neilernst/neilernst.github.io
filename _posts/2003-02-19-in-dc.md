title: In DC

Here I am in Washington DC, Rockville actually, using AOL to post here. I had a "interesting" voyage here, as I am now in the hotel about a day and a half after I was supposed to be here. I somehow picked the so-called Blizzard of 2003 to come out here, so I spent the last day in Toronto before flying out tonight. On top of that, the customs and immigration line-up was ridiculous as all the travellers tried to make their way back home. Finally, Washington-Reagan airport has its own special security measures (including a police officer at the plane's doorway), like 5 separate security checkpoints, due I suppose to the fact the route takes you right over the White House and the Capitol. Anyway, tomorrow I get some work done hopefully and will keep updating this thing.
