title: Are we not Men? We are DEVO
---

Whither evolution of mankind? Seems this species has been thinking
itself better than the rest of the &quot;animals&quot;, a misconception it ought
to rid itself of before it is forcibly extinguished, likely by itself.
If evolutionary pressures acting on other species produce the
magnificient specimens of creatures and plants we see today, why should
humans resist this impulse? Is there more to life than reproduction?
Clinically the answer must be no, a rational response if ever there was
one. But isn't the answer just as much a firm Yes? Can art and
mankind's other spectacular creations be dismissed so readily as just
so much noise in the signal of evolutionary pressure? There is a reason
for existing other than procreation - to have a good time before,
during, and after the event.
