title: Research musings
---

I've been thinking lately about what I'd like to do research on for my Ph.D.  Clearly this will have to meld with things people at UofT are doing, like the KM group, but here's what I feel is exciting me.

I don't feel like I want to do software requirements, or specifications, etc.  While I'll be the first to admit the value of this work, I'm not passionate about making it easier to write software; I mean, if it happens to do that, great, but it isn't something I'm particularly inspired by.

My M.Sc. was on cognitive support for knowledge engineers (actually, I'm still trying to decide what it actually was on, as there are so many angles from which I could approach understanding it - like any author, my thesis represents maybe 10-20% of what I actually thought and wrote down).  I'm still really motivated to explore helping people understand and use computers and technology in general.  Making software easier to create is all well and good, but is it comprehensible to anyone without a 3 day training session?  I'd argue there are a lot of approaches to this, but based on a conversation with my supervisor, John Mylopoulos, I think an interesting perspective is from older people working with technology, technology which I think can be very helpful - ordering online groceries, books, etc. -- as well as essential -- monitoring medicines, memory, and so on.
