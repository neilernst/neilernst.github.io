title: Moving to UVic
---

I'm excited to announce I will be taking up a position this fall as a tenure-track faculty member in the Department of [Computer Science](http://www.uvic.ca/engineering/computerscience/index.php) at the [University of Victoria](http://www.uvic.ca).

This is a great opportunity to work with some of the top software engineering faculty in the world, in one of the best cities in the world (although I'm biased, as it is my hometown :). Victoria is at the forefront of the startup scene, just a few hours from Vancouver, Seattle, and direct flights to the Valley (not Abbotsford, the other one). 

If you are interested in doing research with me please take a look at my ['prospective students'](/prospective) page. Uvic, and Canada, welcome people of all backgrounds. See our [study permit process](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/study/index.asp), and the federal [Express Entry program](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/study/work-postgrad.asp) for post-graduation immigration opportunities.

I want to thank my colleagues and co-workers at Carnegie Mellon and the Software Engineering Institute for a great four years. I've learned a lot about software architecture, large-scale software projects in government agencies, and more US military acronyms than I care to admit. I'll also really miss Pittsburgh, which has been wonderfully welcoming and a pleasant surprise. It's easy to see America through a particular perspective these days, but many---most---Americans are awesome and caring people. 
<!-- Pittsburgh in particular is a leading indicator of problems and opportunities the whole world will have to deal with, in autonomous vehicles, uninterpretable machine learning algorithms, diversity and inclusiveness in technology, and the very question of what work means in a world where we just need less of it. -->
