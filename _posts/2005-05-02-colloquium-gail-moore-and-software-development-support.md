title: 'Colloquium: Gail Moore and Software Development Support'
---

[Gail Moore](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spl/) presented today.  She works on Hipikat and Strathcona.  Some of my notes:

- all projects should get military style names, instead of trying to force acronyms.  Strathcona is cool, but wouldn't "Enduring Awareness" be better, especially with the double entendre?  Or how about "Sudden Knowledge", or "Thunderous Vengeance".  These names clearly say to outsiders: Look out!  We are out to accomplish something!  Hipikat is from an African tribal language, so that's cool too, I guess.

- the Strathcona approach of assisting users with APIs seems to target a very good problem.  I always use the docs a lot, and spend a lot of time searching around for things.  If a tool could make this simpler, I'd buy it.  I think it could work very well in the WS sphere - what calls can I make to this service?  How do I use them.  Something like "APIassist", similar to "CodeAssist" in Eclipse currently.  I think this area needs to distinguish between hardened veterans and newcomers.  Veterans, like the IBM Ottawa staff she mentioned, often know 98% of the interface they need.  So they seem less likely to use a tool for help.  Me, however, not being an expert at, say, the EMF API, need help.

- Question: does an API hierarchy represent an action or structure model of the domain?

- Context could be pulled from the spec or goal model of the system, but who creates something accurate enough?  Gail mentions it would be a win if small changes in existing practices were implemented, e.g., assigning bug-id to commits.

- Advice offered needs to be subtle, like the  icons in Eclipse for indicating suggestions.
