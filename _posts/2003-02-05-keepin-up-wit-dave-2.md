excerpt: 'Today was CD-sales day, sold 75 cds for 150 bucks. The music industry deserves
  to lose every cent they have, as I personally have wasted a lot of money relative
  to my income, way more than those fat cats. Don''t you hate buying a CD because
  it sounded cool in the store, or your buddy said it was great, and then get home
  to find that every song sounds the same? Take Sonic Youth and "Daydream Nation".
  As I watched its darkened cover pass into the chubby hands of the foul-smelling
  music store manager, I nearly heaved a sigh of relief that it was gone.


  Anyhow. Work-wise, I''ve hit a slump, I really am confused about the motivations
  for information visualization of knowledge-bases. I am trying to grasp the conceptual
  requirements and theory for this area (justify my work!), but it''s slow going.
  Peggy''s course had some readings on software viz that seemed really good - Cognitive
  Questions in SW Vis - and I''m trying to write this up for a paper at the Adoption-Centric
  SW Engineering workshop in May.


  Polly and I continue to meld the framework for Shrimp-bib like two trained blacksmiths
  working iron. We are trying to figure out the best way to build a distributed knowledge
  base. See her page for details.'

Today was CD-sales day, sold 75 cds for 150 bucks. The music industry deserves to lose every cent they have, as I personally have wasted a lot of money relative to my income, way more than those fat cats. Don't you hate buying a CD because it sounded cool in the store, or your buddy said it was great, and then get home to find that every song sounds the same? Take Sonic Youth and "Daydream Nation". As I watched its darkened cover pass into the chubby hands of the foul-smelling music store manager, I nearly heaved a sigh of relief that it was gone.
