A popular topic to be sure.

A source of great confusion.

A source of great joy.

A purpose for existing.

My real question for now is constrained to why certain people get along, and why certain people seem to fall apart. For instance, why, after a long period of time, say 7 years, do two people split up? What specific instance causes them to say, Ah, now I must sever myself from you and forget we ever shared anything?

Two of my friends have now had girlfriends for long-ish periods of time (around a year to two years) and made big commitments to them (engagement and cohabitation) only to end up apart from them for good, in somewhat rancorous circumstances. I can tell myself it is perhaps because of this factor or that factor, and yet I know other couples
happily married for 20-30 years, who met under similar circumstances, yet had no such trouble.

Is it perhaps true that there is only one true partner for everyone? I cannot believe that. Simply because there is no way of ever knowing whether a particular person is your so-called soulmate beforehand, therefore one must leap forward with both feet and trust that this may be worth the effort. The chance of getting hurt should never outweigh the possibility of finding the happiness that only a meaningful relationship can bring.
