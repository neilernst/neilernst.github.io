title: No open-source community?
---

An [interesting article](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/12/no_oss_community.html?page=1) by [John Mark Walker](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/au/2549) makes the case for the open-source phenomenon being essentially the product of technological changes inherent in the development of the Internet/Web.  Rather than some philosophical change, open-source tools are due to essentially zero cost structures for development (save for development time).

To that I would add the maturing nature of software programming.  Perhaps the early 90s was the first time that there was a critical mass of people playing around with programming, had the skills to do really neat things with software.  The essay acknowledges a large pool of developers, but I wonder what impact improved skills must have had as well (hopefully some, otherwise what is the point of a C.S. degree? :))

There are some glossed-over aspects that may or may not jibe with reality (the author doesn't state where he sources his statements - empirical studies?). One example is the statement that "[w]ithout prices that approach zero, there is simply no room for viable open source options".  This seems true on its face, e.g. in the GIS market (where software is typically 000s of dollars per licence) there is a [poorer open alternative](http://grass.itc.it/) to the major tools.

Another example is the claim that with internet collaboration one can leverage many more '[eyeballs'](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html) than before, but some work I've read suggests this is less important than suggested.  In many cases, there are a small minority of people doing all the work.  The area needs some more detailed, longitudinal studies of these type of projects to assess statements made by open-source advocates like ESR or Tim O'Reilly.
