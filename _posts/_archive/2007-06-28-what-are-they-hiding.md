title: What are they hiding?
---

I recently read [an article](http://http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/comment/story.html?id=597d0677-2a05-47b4-b34f-b84068db11f4&p=4) (pay-wall, :() by [R. Timothy Anderson](http://nrsp.com/people-tim-patterson.html). It was in the National Post, as part of their series on "[The Deniers](http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/environment/story.html?id=4432a41c-7c52-4b74-934e-f0dac3b2bcb8)", a collection of essays by so-called climate change skeptics (and I think via that link you can get the essays free). It's a really good series, the articles are generally top-class, as are the authors. It's a worthy contribution to a public-policy question that will consume billions of dollars of government money.

At any rate, one of the comments on the blog was by a man named Tom Harris. He mentioned his organization, the [Natural Resources Stewardship Project](http://nrsp.com/), and encouraged readers to check it out.

So I did, poking around for a while. It seems like a group that is dedicated to countering Kyoto hype by adding 'scientific objectivity' to the debate. Well, that's a worthy goal. However, I could not determine who was behind the group - private groups and people, big oil, who? It seems like a relevant question when one is presented with a claim of 'objectivity' (personally, I don't believe in personal objectivity, but I do believe in empiricism -- it's the interpretation where we go wrong).

So I emailed Mr Harris, the CEO for the group, about his sources of support.


<blockquote>Hello, I would like to know what agencies, individuals, or corporations are funding your program, and to what proportions. I had great difficulty discovering this on your website, but I'm sure you wouldn't mind revealing this.

thanks!

and his response (admirably quickly):


<blockquote>Before I address your question, have you asked Greenpeace and Sierra the
same question?</blockquote>


Not the response I was expecting. Now, I suppose my query might be construed as hostile, but Mr. Harris could have my support -- I'm already reading the "Deniers" series, I've checked his website ... my response to him:


<blockquote>I hadn't, but found this on the Greenpeace website:
"Greenpeace does not solicit or accept funding from governments, corporations or political parties. Greenpeace neither seeks nor accepts donations that could compromise our independence, aims, objectives or integrity. Our campaigns are funded by the generosity of individuals and grant support from foundations."

I'm not sure how this is relevant, though. Your organization's information states you are a "non-profit, non-partisan organization". What do Greenpeace's activities have to do with my question?

thanks for your feedback,
neil ernst</blockquote>


I'm still awaiting a reply, three days later. I find it disappointing that an organization dedicated to objectivity and clarity can't be upfront with me about this issue.  Are they hiding something? Or is Mr. Harris just really busy all of a sudden? I'll post more here if and when it becomes available. Until then, label me a skeptic about the NRSP.
