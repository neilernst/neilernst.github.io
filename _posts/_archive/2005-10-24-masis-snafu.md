title: 'MASIS: SNAFU'

[Interesting article](http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1130105407572&call_pageid=970599119419&DPL=IvsNDS%2f7ChAX&tacodalogin=yes) in the Toronto Star today (reg. required) about the Canadian military's inventory management system, [MASIS](http://72.14.207.104/search?q=cache:blPBZK98dbMJ:www.vcds.forces.gc.ca/dgsp/00native/rep-pub/ddm/rpp/rpp05-06/mcp_e.pdf+masis+dod&hl=en&client=firefox-a#21). Apparently the system is way behind schedule, over budget, and has been subject to constant revision and scope creep.  How not to run a software project, I suppose.
