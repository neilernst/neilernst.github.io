title: Why (Not) Agile?
---

Scott Ambler [makes the point](http://agiletoolkit.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=16591) that confronting stakeholders with the need to take control scares them. They would rather give someone a million dollars and some specs, have them fail, and then blame the contractor.  Taking charge is scary and confrontational.  Having to provide feedback and information is something they rarely do. The control the stakeholders now get to exercise is lost in the fear of failure. Change management is often about change prevention.

One strong motivation for following an agile approach is its ability to quickly respond to changes in the Environment. The Standish report investigated what delivered functionality was actually used (this is for projects that succeeded) . The results showed that only 20\% of features were used always or often. 2/3rds of the requirements were rarely or never used. The reason the report gives is that over the long development lifecycle, the Environment is changing, as well as stakeholder understanding of their needs relative to the Environment. Furthermore, often a `kitchen sink' approach is taken, with stakeholders keen to define anything they might possibly need at the beginning.

Agile approaches can help by adopting the perspective that change is a constant in system design. Tools, including models, should only be adopted if they address an immediate need.
