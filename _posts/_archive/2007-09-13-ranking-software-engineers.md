I [came across](http://catenary.wordpress.com/2007/09/10/an-undiscovered-discipline/) a paper[1] via the [Nebraska-Lincoln](http://esquared.unl.edu/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage) Empirical Software Engineering site that ranks software engineering schools and scholars. The authors assess importance based on citations in [_IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering_](http://www.computer.org/portal/site/transactions/menuitem.a66ec5ba52117764cfe79d108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=tse_home/&), [_ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology_](http://tosem.acm.org/), and the conferences [_ICSE_](http://www.icse-conferences.org/), and [_FSE_](http://www.idt.mdh.se/esec-fse-2007/). I think most researchers would agree these are the top venues for software engineering, although I might quibble with the merits of the journals, since important new research is typically sent to conferences. Also, when a conference has an acceptance rate in the single digits, it tends to drive people to more specialized venues, which aren't incorporated here, e.g., RE, ASE, Models, and so on.
The list is hidden in a PDF behind the ACM's "Digital Library", which isn't a library at all, since users have to pay a lot of money to access it.  So I've reproduced it here, because it's interesting. One thing to note is that UofT, my school, is 26th, and behind UBC, Waterloo, and Carleton. There is a perception at UofT that we are not just the 'best' in Canada, but _by far_ the best. Clearly, [like Avis](http://www.theoutsidebuzz.com/article.asp?article_ID=17), we need to try harder. At least in these four venues.

**Update:**

I came across another ranking of researchers. [This one](http://www.springerlink.com/content/9066k88471343v63/?p=92ed1b85486640bd8d987a92583278ff&pi=0) [2] is specific to requirements engineering. Here, the University of Toronto fares much better:[![](http://fink08.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/re-rank.png)](http://fink08.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/re-rank.png)
