title: Mehrdad on Views
---

[Mehrdad](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mehrdad/) gave a talk on view merging today in the [Early-RE](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/km/istar/EarlyREseminars.html) seminar. Here are a few notes:




	
  * What is the difference btw views, viewpoints, and goal models and aspects?

	
  * A view is a primary modeling element

	
  * Viws are consistent with one another; viewpts are ad-hoc and not necc. consistent (from RE05 paper).

	
  * There is a distinction between merging and matching.  Mehrdad assumes the views are already matched.  Matching seems to e the most difficult aspect - getting agreement on what terms mean, which terms are related - how to compose the interconnection diagram.

	
  * Traceability is a big feature of this approach, and useful for social processes too.

	
  * I'm a little confused by the notion of going beyond (disagreement) in the matrix.  Couldn't two people agree that something should be accepted?  This would happen in the next iteration I guess.

	
  * The interconnection diagrams express hypotheses about the merged model.

	
  * Anootation reflect comments on someone's view of the domain.

	
  * It isn't possible to completely automate the process; literature seems to support this.

	
  * Should explicitly recognize notion of Time in the merges... for requirements negotiation.
