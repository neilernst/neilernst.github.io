title: the wikipedia
---

I've read a few articles/commentaries from individuals, usually information science types (taxonomists, librarians, etc.) complaining that the Wikipedia project is misleading, erroneous, and a threat to society.

I guess being so involved in the field means they have lost perspective.  When I do a search on Wkipedia, I'm not expecting a result that helps me write a dissertation in the area.  Rather, I'm looking for a sip of the spring of knowledge, a taste that will satisfy my interest.  And you know what?  I've rarely been disappointed.  Sure, a date may be wrong here, or a bias may be obvious, but is anyone seriously claiming other secondary sources don't have exactly the same issue?  It's just hidden better.

And the immense power of the Wikipedia experiment has value beyond the actual physical thing.  People messing with wikipedia, like the proverbial monkeys, have made something of enormous usefulness, in a short span of time.  Something the human race can be proud of.
