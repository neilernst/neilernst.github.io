Having just read a book on [Toyota Production System (TPS)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071392319?ie=UTF8&tag=httpwwwgoodco-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0071392319&SubscriptionId=1MGPYB6YW3HWK55XCGG2), and following various developments in [lean software development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development), I was curious to know what Toyota itself was doing with respect to software. Software forms a large part of new vehicles (I've heard figures like 50% of new car development costs), so this seems like a good place to use notions like continuous improvement, visual management, waste reduction, etc.

I gather as part of a "Lean" tour of Japan, various Lean software thought-leaders ([Mary Poppendieck](http://www.poppendieck.com/), among others) had occasion to meet with the head of Toyota's software division. From the description of the meeting, it sounded like Toyota were doing fairly standard BRUF development -- analyze, plan, implement, test, deliver. Some people call this 'waterfall' but personally, I don't think that term has ever been well-defined.  Certainly I doubt anyone has ever said, "Hey, let's do waterfall on this project!"

So from the [initial description](http://gabriellebenefield.blogspot.com/2009/04/mr.html#links), fairly standard development, but, being Toyota, there's more to the story. Mary Poppendieck [elaborated on her understanding](http://www.xqa.com.ar/visualmanagement/2009/04/confirmed-toyota-does-waterfall/), suggesting that in the process control domain, the three month cycle is quite fast (close to some Scrum sprint lengths of 1 month, anyway). There is also some interesting follow-up discussion [here](http://www.bestbrains.dk/Blog/CommentView,guid,98913a0d-8279-464f-82fd-9723e5df77b0.aspx#commentstart) and [here](http://softwaredevelopmenttoday.blogspot.com/2009/04/does-toyota-really-use-waterfall-for.html). The takeaway seems to be that 'context is everything'.  The other takeaway might be "Toyota isn't perfect".
