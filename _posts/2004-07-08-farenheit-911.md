title: Farenheit 9/11
---

Saw [Moore's film](http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/fahrenheit911/) tonight, in a local theatre that was absolutely packed.  I think this probably speaks to what seems to me to be a fairly strong dislike for George W. Bush in Canada.

I liked the film, but I think it was strongest when it avoided what seemed to me to be somewhat childish digs at the Administration (who doesn't look bad in slow-motion?).  When Moore put aside his rhetorical jabs and focused on the untold stories of the decision to invade Iraq, the film was at its best.

I really don't envy people the decision to go to war, and I suppose my greatest wish is that a leader like Bush, or Chretien, or Blair, truly appreciates the consequences of what he or she decides.  My opinion is the Bush did not, and still does not, nor do his coterie of advisors like the 'brilliant' Paul Wolfowitz.
