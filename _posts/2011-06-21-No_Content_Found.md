title: Open problems in requirements engineering
---

All too often RE researchers argue at cross-purposes. I think this is a sign of an immature field, because at the heart, we have not agreed what interesting problems should be resolved to advance the state of the art. Herewith a few possible candidates for open problems, of the P=NP? variety. Note that a good open problem definition is short, has existing formulations, and solutions to it can be verified in a short amount of time. Hence, "solve traceability" is not a good open problem.



	
  1. Characterize the worst-case performance of RE reasoning.

	
  2. Give a philosophical definition of RE concepts.

	
  3. Design an error-free, human-free technique for linking requirements to a) architecture b) code/implementation
