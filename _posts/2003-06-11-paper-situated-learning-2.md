  Interesting paper that details a study looking at using ethnography to see how a
  knowledge management strategy succeeded or failed in the workplace.  <!--break-->Comes
  at it from a MIS perspective.  Basically, the authors found that the top down management
  style completely failed to recognize rather pervasive differences in work style
  of the lower ranks.  <blockquote>"People will only change enough to keep their jobs".</blockquote>


  Thesis: must understand ''networks of knowledge'' in order to comprehend the true
  relationships between the knowledge and the workers.


  Uses an ethnographic case study approach, combining site-specific interviews with
  participant observation and material reviews (emails, corporate documents, etc.)

  Note that the ethnographic process included a <b>strong reflective component</b>,
  and the authors emphasize how it is crucial to review the notes several times.


  Generated some key concepts as metaphors: ''low-hanging fruit'', -&gt; easily accomplished
  changes.  These were later seen as red-herrings, fooling people into thinking that
  there was substantive change when all that was occurring were cosmetic differences.


  Conclusion: <blockquote>"In general, these suggest that the expectations of the
  top-down initiative in being proactive and encouraging ''ask-why'' thinking were
  at odds with the realities and constraints posed by the situated knowledge web.  The
  goals of the top-down effort were consequently undermined and the outcomes reflect
  the consequences of the lack of cognizance of the features of the situated knowledge
  web."</blockquote> :die:'
