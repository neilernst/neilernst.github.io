title: On Software Design of a Customizable Visualization Tool
---

Had a good discussion with Rob today about some of my ideas for customizeable SHriMP.  Turns out he was thinking along the same sort of lines anyway.  Jeff is the expert on customization so we will have to involve him as well.  
  
The first question is, If we are moving toward designing SHriMP as a pluggable architecture (cf. [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org)), then why not just use Eclipse to do all our high level management, such as switching between different projects, different perspectives, etc.  There might be a problem with doing this if we can't integrate this into Protege easily.  However, doesn't Eclipse provide a core set of classes we could use without needing its UI?  Have to look into this.
