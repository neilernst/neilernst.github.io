Last day of the Semantic Web conference.

SW: Dennis Quan, MIT speaker about the [Haystack ](http://haystack.lcs.mit.edu)application,
- making lots of points about how there is a chasm (semantic gap) between UI and data model
-> data model seeks to be efficient, non-duplication, scalable
-> UI want usability, discoverable, personalizable (customizable), intuitive
Wants an ontology that realizes the user needs and displays them for the user(!)
- enable semantic web from the user's perspective
- make resources first class (a movie is the key, not the navigation elements)
- mark up an ontology with OWL to give hints to inference engines about the metadata
