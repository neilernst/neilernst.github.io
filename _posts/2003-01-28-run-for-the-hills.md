Found a really cool mozilla extension today, Checky, which is a system for checking a variety of validation services like the W3C Html validator and RDF validator. Very useful. Mozilla has achieved a fantastic level of support at this point, I highly recommend it - mozdev.org has many projects doing all sorts of neat things. I think developing web apps with the Mozilla XUL toolkit has the potential to impact on Java applets as a cross-platform development environment.

As for schoolwork, today I re-read the comments on the InfoVis paper and will be editing that paper over the next few days to update it. Also, Polly and I are scheduled for a SENGCO in May on our shrimp-bib project. We need to meet over the next few days to hash it out and start implementation. It is very exciting. We are waiting for Peggy to meet with the tech guys to see how the server will be run.
