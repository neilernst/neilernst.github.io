Paper concerns an implementation of a KR system in Visio.  No clear evaluation of the technique.  
  

Some limits: 

  * how well does it handle large ontologies such as the NCI?
  * who actually does use Visio?
  * Who are the target users?
  * Generally, it seems easier to create knowledge on a per-node basis, rather than in context (seeing other nodes).  DL does this for people, allowing them to focus on the details of a specific instance without knowing where it is (perhaps too much though).
I'm also not sure what user audience this is targeted to.  The modelling still seems overly complicated for the real novice, and the expert might find it too simplistic.  This is a danger in ACKE tools I think.  Still, I liked the approach they took.  See [SemTalk](http://www.semtalk.com) for more info.
