title: Amarok 2.0
---

Word is the Amarok team will be working on 2.0 release for summer. The reason this is great is that it means [Amarok,](http://amarok.kde.org/) by far the best music player, will soon be working on Windows and Macs as well as Linux. It's a program that doesn't insist that its designers know more about your habits than you do (like every freakin' Mac application seems to!).Â  I highly recommend checking it out when available.

Or, you could just "switch" to a really hip OS, like Linux and its flavours.
