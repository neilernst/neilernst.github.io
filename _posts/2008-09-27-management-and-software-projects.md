I've tried to resist being swayed by the 'softer' side of software science: business practices, management science, process improvement, etc., all of which I feel are challenging to evaluate scientifically.

However, a recent paper,  [A Replicated Survey of IT Software Project Failures](http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2dd7d71bb02462f23b6acb0a159c4bd52/neilernst), suggests that if we want software projects to succeed in IT, than these aspects are perhaps the best place to focus our attention.The paper is a refreshing improvement on [the Standish reports](http://www.neilernst.net/archives/2008/requirements-and-business-project-management/).

Of the top five reasons a project was cancelled, three were management-related: Senior management not sufficiently involved (33%), too many requirements and scope changes (33%), and lack of necessary management skills (28%). The other two were project over budget (which presumably has many possible causes), and a lack of necessary technical skills (22%).

As software engineering researchers, I would argue that a lot of our work is focused on the last reason (technical skills) or less important causes (e.g. technology problems). There is a large research community dedicated to requirements research, but arguably this community is seen as less important (compare, for example, papers in ICSE 2008: of  103 papers, only 6 were requirements related).

These results also suggest what I've suspected: the choice of technology (C#, Java, SQLServer, AJAX, etc) is less important than getting a good team together, with properly scoped requirements and a sound leadership vision. As [Karl Pilkington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pilkington) would say, the rest is just 'pfaffing about'.

Thanks to Jorge and Lorin Hochstein for the pointer.
