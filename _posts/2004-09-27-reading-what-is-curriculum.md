title: 'Reading: What is Curriculum?'
---

Egan, Kieran.  1978.  What is Curriculum?  _Curriculum Inquiry_ 8:1 p. 65-72.



This article closes with the argument that rather than leave the future alone as some uncontrollable presence, we strive to make some progress towards deciding what that future will look like.  One good way to do this is to decide on the _what_ and the _how_ of education quickly and with certainty.  No doubt there is a range of socio-critical theory that could be used to critique this concept, but the article makes a steady stroll through the historical record to justify this angle.
