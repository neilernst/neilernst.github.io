title: Movie recommendation
---

I watched [Pan's Labyrinth](http://imdb.com/title/tt0457430) last night, and highly recommend it. Mind you, despite the similarity of the title to the [David Bowie movie](http://imdb.com/title/tt0091369/), I don't think this movie is good for small children.  There are some really graphic scenes of violence that (I would hope) small kids shouldn't see.

The fantasy sequences were really cool, in my mind the perfect use of CGI - subtle, understated, just enough to really leverage the power of film-making.

The Spanish title of the movie seems to translate as the Labyrinth of the Faun, so I wonder to what degree the Spanish word _Fauno_ and the English Pan are equivalent - Pan is a deity with a definite history, whereas fauns are more generic.  There was a lot of reference to fantastic creatures that I assume are part of Spanish/Mexican folklore... I would like to know more about some of these legends.

The movie raises interesting questions about the effect of war, violence, and terror on young people. It made me think of all the children in the world who have to deal with unimaginable violence in their daily lives, such as the child soldiers of Sierra Leone, or even victims of abuse in North America. How do these kids cope with that, and the lack of control and power they have over their own lives?

The other theme I enjoyed was the use of "imaginary" horror versus the real thing. Often we 'escape' to watch terror on television, e.g. 24, Lost, <strike>Grey's Anatomy</strike>, and forget that which is often just outside our windows.

One last thing I pondered as I thought about the movie, and that is the relationship between Mexicans and Spaniards. This was a Mexican movie, directed by a Mexican, but set in Spain, and using -- I think -- Spanish actors - at least speaking with that distinctive lisping C accent.  Does the Spanish Civil War resonate with Mexicans? Did they get involved? What is the current relationship like? Is it like the British Commonwealth?
