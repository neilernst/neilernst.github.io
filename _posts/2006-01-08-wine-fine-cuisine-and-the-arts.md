title: Wine, fine cuisine, and the arts
---

Many people, and much money, go for a nice wine.  We are told a certain wine has a particular bouquet, a 'good nose', rich body, etc. etc.  Similarly, certain chefs get accoladed for their 'exquisite' creations, melt-in-the-mouth tastes.... The arts have the same hierarchy of taste.  Picasso is better than Pollock.  Better than the 50 other modernists working at the same time.  Coltrane is better than other jazz saxophonists.

Why?  Perhaps it's my post-modernist tendencies, but I don't think there is any objective criteria for any of these value judgements, except, perhaps, in the broad strokes - e.g. 5$ Chilean wine is worse than 50$ French wine.  And this is more because of the skill of the creator than anything else -- that is, Picasso was a better brush-stroker, the Chilean winery uses goat urine to fill out the colour...
Two things lead me to this conclusion.  One is the discovery, during the Pepsi Challenge, that most people can't actually tell what they're consuming (as documented in [Blink, by M. Gladwell](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316172324/qid=1136478059/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_0/701-2363650-8790753)).  In fact, the branding of the product contributes much more readily to the perception of flavour and taste.  Along the same lines, there is much work in social psychology illustrating that people really don't understand why they like what they like.  One psychologist, Richard Nisbett, posits that familiarity is the biggest reason for why we like something more:


<blockquote>The study has been done. Rats brought up listening to music                     by Mozart prefer to move to the side of the cage that trips                     a switch allowing them to listen to Mozart rather than Schoenberg.                     Rats raised on Schoenberg prefer to be on the Schoenberg                     side. The rats were not asked the reasons for their musical                     preferences. (from [http://www.edge.org/q2006/q06_3.html#nisbett.](http://www.edge.org/q2006/q06_3.html#nisbett)</blockquote>


Along the same lines is the writing of [Donald Hoffman](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/bios/hoffman.html), that there is no shared sense of what an object is -- we each experience it separately.  So how can we say that a given wine is better?  Clearly, something other than objective characteristics (like body, nose, colour) are at play.  Complex social interactions are, I would argue, the biggest reason why we say something is better than another (e.g., because it's French, because I paid a lot for it, because it's scarce...).
