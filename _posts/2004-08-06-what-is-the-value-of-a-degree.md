title: What is the value of a degree?
---

My M.Sc. cost me nothing in dollar terms, as I was funded to do it (thanks to NSERC, the NCI, and the university).  But it did take 3 years of potential earnings from me (the cost of not working at a higher paying job was probably around 20-30k a year).  I emerged with a Master's degree from a respected institution, which conceivably would secure me, over my lifetime, earnings equal to the amount I decided to forego.

As well, I have matured as a researcher and scholar, can write good academic papers and reports, have managed a fairly intense research program, and have assorted technical skills.
