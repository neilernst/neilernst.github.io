From XML.com:
[Styling RDF Graphs with GSS](http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/12/03/gss.html)
  


<blockquote>Visualising RDF graphs is a hard problem, as they can quickly become unwieldy. This article introduces a solution in the form off GSS (Graph Style Sheets), an RDF vocabulary for describing rule-based style sheets used to modify the visual representation of RDF models represented as node-link diagrams.</blockquote>


Much like Web stylesheets, Graph stylesheets apply rules to certain well-defined sets of items in order to customize the display.  For example, in Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), you can make all H1 tags red.
