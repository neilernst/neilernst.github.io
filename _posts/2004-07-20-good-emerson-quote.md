title: Good Emerson quote
---

From [Michael Nielsen](http://www.qinfo.org/people/nielsen/blog/archive/tough-learning/tough-learning-final.html)  

The American Philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson said it well in his essay "Self-Reliance":


<blockquote>
It is easy in the world to live after the worldâ€™s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.</blockquote>
