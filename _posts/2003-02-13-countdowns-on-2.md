excerpt: '..til I get to DC. I seem to pick the worst times, last time it was the
  sniper, now some sort of Orange Alert. I have to cancel the car reservation as I
  think that will be too much hassle. Not sure how I will get to the NCI, perhaps
  cab there and then walk back. Depends on the weather.

  Today I got a lot written on the ACSE paper. I have sent it to Peggy for a quick
  review as it''s due on the 15th.

  Recently a lot of meetings have taken place, and it seems like a real skill to acquire
  to know which ones to go to. Sometimes when you''re busy a meeting just feels like
  a real waster of time; other times it''s this really enjoyable opportunity to socialize
  and interact with other intelligent beings.


  Looked at IBM''s babble project today. I like the ideas, but I don''t see chat being
  used this much yet. Perhaps in another few years people will chat and collaborate
  more, and offices will all be paperles.... :)'
