title: Combining customization and visualization in Jambalaya
---

Some notes on making Shrimp a more intelligent tool:  
  
First, I believe what our tools are really about is communication and discovery.  I want to leverage our group's research in customization and software engineering with the work we've done in discovering visualization requirements for knowledge engineering, and use that to address issues of adoption.  
  
Rob and I had been talking about making Shrimp into something more customizable.  Originally I had thought this would just be via scripting, but in talking with Peggy, I've created an ontology that would represent the model of the Shrimp application (actually, the Jambalaya aspect thereof).  The idea is that Guru users would use this model to customize what aspects of Jambalaya would be available to their users, e.g. which tools to show, which view to start with, which scripts to run, which composite arcs to create.
