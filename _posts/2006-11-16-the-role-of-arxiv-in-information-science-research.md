title: The role of arXiv in information science research
---

The [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/) site started as a preprint server for high-energy physics. The motivation was that It was important for researchers to gain access to preliminary findings from others. ArXiv has expanded into other fields, such as mathematics and information sciences. For computer science, there is a [Computing Research Repository](http://arxiv.org/corr/) (CORR) that is an affiliate of ArXiv.

This initiative is very interesting. The criteria for submission seem somewhat vague, other than that the paper should be a substantial scholarly work, e.g., conference length or more. There are no abstracts permitted. However, there are few, if any, review processes, which suggests that any report could be submitted, regardless of its acceptance with other members of the community. Technical reports, which are typically unaccepted, preliminary research reports, are acceptable at this site.

I like this notion on the face of it, because there is much good work that doesn't fit well into a particular venue.  As well, as I've been getting deeper and deeper into a particular area (evolving information systems), I've found that several of the papers I want to read by related researchers are inaccessible, because that researcher hasn't made it available, and the proceedings are often unavailable for months after the actual event. Even better, the CORR provides RSS feeds of new papers, so you can stay right on top of things.

I think there are two issues here. One is a windmill masquerading as a dragon: that one cannot tell how useful a particular paper is. The reason I say this is really a non-issue is because the people for whom this site is most useful will be able to tell relatively quickly how 'good' a paper is.  Really, that's one of the criteria for being a scientist, the ability to evaluate other work. If you cannot do this, then this repository isn't going to be that useful anyway, and you're better off with a peer-reviewed publication. For example, if I were to begin working in a field I didn't know much about, like formal methods, then I would avoid non-reviewed archives in favour of the top conferences and journals.  There seem to be two issues in rating paper quality. One is the objective value of the paper, namely, did it follow appropriate scientific methods, is it well-argued, does it refer to previous approaches, and so on. These criteria can only truly be evaluated by peers of the authors, who are familiar with the field and its objective quality criteria.  The second issue is relative quality, that is, how well does it match up with what I'm interested in? Is it advancing my knowledge of a particular field? I suggest the two criteria are inter-twined.
The challenge, if there is one, is to determine when and what should be submitted to this repository. Should I be putting all my preprints and tech reports there? To date I've been trusting Google to index the PDFs and stick them on Google Scholar or Citeseer, but perhaps a more formal (and stable!) repository is better.

Like anything, CORR is going to succeed only if a good number of researchers manage to adopt it. Otherwise, there will be, as now, the occasional nugget of interest, but traditional venues will remain the source of the latest information.

**Edit:**

I found the following upon further reading. Still sets the bar lower than typical peer-review.


<blockquote>During the submission process, we may require authors who are submitting papers to an archive or subject class for the first time to get an _endorsement_ from another arXiv author.We may give some people automatic endorsements based on topic, previous submissions, and academic affiliation.  People who've already authored papers in arXiv will receive automatic endorsements so they can continue submitting papers in areas that they are active in. During the initial deployment of the system, we may also give automatic endorsements to submitters from known academic institutions.

We will tune the endorsement and autoendorsement criteria for specific archives and subject classes to fit the needs of specific communities, and expect to make changes in our criteria over time.</blockquote>
