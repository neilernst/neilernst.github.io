Chapter 1, The Logic of Relations, is imposing, but later chapters reveal Russell's fine command of philosophical argument and a remarkably clear and understandable style.





<blockquote>(p. 180) I think vagueness is very much more important in the theory of knowledge than you would judge it to be from the writings of most people.  Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize until you have tried to make it precise, and everything precise is so remote from everything that we normally think, that you cannot for a moment suppose that is what we really mean when we say what we think.</blockquote>
