title: Stratford — Coriolanus
---

My wife and I went to [Stratford](http://www.stratford-festival.on.ca/), Ontario, yesterday, to watch the play [_Coriolanus_.](http://www-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/coriolanus/) In the lead role was Canadian actor [Colm Feore](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0272173/), who was one of the reasons we decided to see this play, as opposed to something more lively, like _Oliver!_.

I am not terribly articulate about theatre, but I felt this play -- the play itself, not the production -- was atypical of Shakespeare. The language was not as colourful or playful as some plays I've studied and seen. There was a strong focus on the tragic and the dramatic -- swordplay, mob scenes. It felt more like modern drama than a Shakespearean play. I suppose I'm used to plays like Richard III, where the main character soliloquizes (?) about life and his situation. Coriolanus seems more determined on his course of action, and I felt the audience had less opportunity to know the character. The minor characters were less developed as well, I felt. This is perhaps a good example of Shakespeare showing us, rather than telling us, about characters. In other plays he uses more expository scenes to establish motivation.

I really enjoyed the themes of the play. The 'people' are used as a single character, alternately happy, then dismayed, with their leaders.  It seemed a cynical interpretation of democracy in action, with the people appearing fickle and untrustworthy. I wonder if Shakespeare was appealing to his royal patrons. However, I've read elsewhere that this play has had both worker (Marxist) and aristocratic interpretations, so perhaps I was missing something.

Colm Feore was good, it seemed, although I have little to compare him to.  Certainly he was in command of the role and lines, charging up and down stairs, appearing haughty, then ashamed, then imperious, all in a single scene.  The play received a standing ovation at the end, inevitably I suppose, since all performances seem to get this nowadays. At the end Feore left the stage looking somewhat annoyed, I thought, but perhaps he was still in character -- displeased at the mob's reaction!  I am impressed that he manages to act in three major roles, sometimes two in the same day.  A true professional.
