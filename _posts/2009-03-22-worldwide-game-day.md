Yesterday I partook in [Worldwide Game Day](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4dnd/gameday), a very clever marketing effort from the producers of Dungeons and Dragons, the role-playing game. Local game stores sign up, get some pre-generated materials, including the game scenario, character sheets, maps, and plastic minis that model the characters. Ever since stumbling on Wil Wheaton's [podcasted gaming sessions](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4pod/20090218), which were hilarious and fun, I wanted to try D&D, and this seemed like a good opportunity -- no experience needed.

I have never played D&D, which is surprising, since I'm a nerd, and like reading fantasy, and I'm male, and into computers, and, well, a nerd. I do have good personal hygiene and a low BMI, though, as did the other people I met, so this stereotype is patently untrue. However, nutrition during the game was difficult, choices being street meat, pizza, or .. sushi. Yeah, I had the pizza. And a soda. BMI increased I would say.

I went to [401 Games](http://www.401games.ca/) on Yonge and Gerrard for the event. They have a games room on the third floor, up a fire-hazardous warren of halls and stairways. A room filled with younger people (high school I would say) playing Magic the Gathering. In the corner were some older folks, university age I would say, studying character sheets. I was number 7, an awkward number in role playing games, which are typically geared towards five + the game runner (DM - but 'dungeon master' sounds silly to me). However, soon three others showed up, so we split into two groups. For some reason I had thought there would be more people, but that was the total for the day. By 1pm we had sorted everything out, the DM-for-a-day had quickly read through the scenario, and we were underway. Luckily someone brought extra dice (you need various polyhedral dice).

I had chosen a Paladin, a sort of warrior priest, borne of dragons, yet bipedal ... there's a lot of backstory in D&D that I am not familiar with.Â  My first action was decidedly ignoble -- I moved across a puddle of water, failed an acrobatics check (being large and encumbered with stout weapons and armor) and lay face down in the mud. Not at all heroic. Later on, I would fail a leap across a river of ichor, and end up trapped in there while the rest of the party were destroyed by a demon. The cool thing about role playing is that when the dice are rolled, and mathematically you fail to make the leap, you can visualize this in your mind as "I back up a few paces, gauge the distance, and charge the gap, armor clanging noisily. Just as I approach the lip of the river, my foot slips on some monster slime, and I plunge headlong into the gore".

Since three of the party were very inexperienced, I think our game took longer than usual - 4 hours for three 'encounters' - and by the end, 6pm or so, things were dragging. Everyone had wives, husbands, partners and whatnot, it being a Saturday evening. I'd made some mistakes with my character, and was rather badly off, and the result was a defeat for our party, which had also 'lost' its chief damage-dealer to homework duties. If we had wrapped up after the second encounter, I think it would have been more satisfying.

The other people at the table were great, getting into the spirit of things, and the DM really got into it, ranting darkly about the "Chained God", shouting and cursing as we attacked his creatures. Really cool. It would be a lot of fun to build up a character, seriously or semi-seriously (along the lines of 'Jim Darkmagic'), and get familiar with the available feats and powers, to avoid the constant checking of the character sheet.

Next step is to find some other people and try to set up my own game, as everyone there already played a weekly game (or lived in the hinterland, e.g. north of Eglinton). Anyone interested?
