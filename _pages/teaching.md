* [CSC 497 - Interdisciplinary Project](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/view/5cbdf52d2a310a240068a51d)
  * This is the project capstone for students in any combined program. I advise students in [Geomatics](https://www.uvic.ca/students/undergraduate/program-planning/program-worksheets/worksheets/ppw-ss-geog-csc-combined.pdf). This course is scheduled by completing the [Directed Studies (Pro Forma) form](https://www.uvic.ca/registrar/assets/docs/record-forms/pro-forma.pdf) available here. The project must combine elements of Geography (landscapes, geomorphology, human geography, climate change, etc. etc.) and Computer Science (software development, algorithms, networking, visualization, etc. etc.). 
  * The format of the project is decided with the project advisor, but must include a final report and final public presentation (usually at a group meeting or department seminar). I strongly recommend weekly reports as a deliverable. The project should take 10-15 hours per week to complete. You cannot use content from other courses for this project, but building on top of those results is fine.
  * Past projects have included comparing ML algorithms on remote sensing data, predicting urban growth, and mapping plankton blooms. 
  * The course needs to have an advisor; students can find one on their own, or work with me on a topic. A good approach is to find a professor whose classes you have enjoyed and ask them directly. Most profs are more than happy to advise an independent research project that aligns with their ongoing research. 
  * This is (supposed to be) a fun course! You get to work on ideas and problems that are interesting to you.
  * Failing is possible, and usually happens when students do not keep up with the work.
