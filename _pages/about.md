<img src="/images/neil-ernst-small.jpg" alt="My profile pic" class="l-img">

I'm a senior member of the technical staff at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

I primarily do research in requirements engineering, repository mining, and software architecture. My main interest is the intersection between requirements and architecture, the so-called “Twin Peaks” (not the show sadly). I am an instructor for the SEI’s Documenting Software Architecture course, and also serve on project teams with the SEI’s industry and government clients, primarily helping with architectural analysis and modernization roadmaps.

I serve in various roles as workshop and conference organizer, program committees, journal reviews, etc. Currently:

* Steering committee, Intl Working Conf. on [Source Code Analysis and Manipulation](http://www.ieee-scam.org) (SCAM). Submit to SCAM in Beijing 2017!
* Organizing committee, [Intl Conf. on Software Architecture](http://icsa-conferences.org), 2018
* Data track PC, [Intl Conf. on Requirements Engineering](http://re2017.org) 2017

## Previously:

* postdoc in software engineering at the University of British Columbia.
* PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto.
* Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Victoria
* undergraduate research in geography and GIS at the University of Victoria, including work placements with the BC Ministry of the Environment.
