I'm a senior member of the technical staff at the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

I primarily do research in requirements engineering, repository mining, and software architecture. My main interest is the intersection between requirements and architecture, the so-called “Twin Peaks” (not the show sadly). I am an instructor for the SEI’s Documenting Software Architecture course, and also serve on project teams with the SEI’s industry and government clients, primarily helping with architectural analysis and modernization roadmaps.

I serve in various roles as workshop and conference organizer, program committees, journal reviews, etc. Currently I am Engineering Tools co-chair for the Intl Conf. on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM). 

## Previously:

* postdoc in software engineering at the University of British Columbia.
* PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Toronto.
* Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Victoria
* undergraduate research in geography and GIS at the University of Victoria, including work placements with the BC Ministry of the Environment.
