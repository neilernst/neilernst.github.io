| Jorge Aranda                       | Columbus did get his proposal “reviewed,” by Portuguese, Genovese, Venetian, and Spanish experts, and it was turned down every time, on the grounds that his math was pretty wrong and the Earth was bigger than he wished. They knew (as most literate people then) that the Earth was round, and they knew roughly its size—Columbus must’ve seen to them a bit of a quack. He got funded pretty much on a whim by the Spanish crown, and they just happened to get lucky: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Quest_for_financial_support_for_a_voyage>                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Columbus’s Heilmeyer Catechism                                                               | 2016/07/19 at 6:34 pm  |

| Stefan Wagner                      | I think the first one is solved in principle. There are so many archiving options out there now that also give you a DOI. I specifically like ZENODO which is able to archive specific versions from GitHub.  The second one is really a problem. I guess we should have an opt-in mechanism in GitHub and similar platforms for participating in such studies.                                                                                                                                   | On Using Open Data in Software Engineering                                                   | 2016/03/08 at 5:26 am  |
| Neil Ernst                         | In reply to Jorge Aranda. Yeah, the point here is to add the right tests, so that one uncovering (important) bugs should have been closer to the first one added.

| Jorge Aranda                       | There are diminishing returns on extra tests for sure—but still, sometimes I find that a test I previously thought almost pointless uncovers bugs, and that just reinforces my need to test as heavily as I can.                                            | The Marginal Utility of Testing/Refactoring/Thinking                                         | 2016/01/21 at 2:41 pm  |
| Neil Ernst                         | In reply to fabianodalpiaz. I guess it falls under ML tools … but you’re right. I really like Garm’s work though.                                                                                  | Requirements, Agile, and Finding Errors                                                      | 2015/12/22 at 12:56 pm |
| fabianodalpiaz                     | Nice post! It is curious that you don’t mention NLP explicitly. In the PhD work of Garm Lucassen (e.g., <http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~dalpi001/papers/luca-dalp-werf-brin-15-re.pdf>), we use simple NLP techniques to improve the quality of user stories (… we don’t impose new notations ).Dan Berry’s dumb tools paper (The Case for Dumb Requirements Engineering Tools, REFSQ’12) inspired our work: a useful automated tool for RE is one that achieves (close to?) 100% recall; the cost may be to sacrifice precision, but at least the analyst doesn’t have to recheck all the requirements.Our tool is deployed as a service and integrates with Jira/Pivotal. Integration with SonarQube as you suggest is definitely interesting!                                                     | Requirements, Agile, and Finding Errors                                                      | 2015/12/08 at 5:39 am  |
| Jorge Aranda                       | In reply to Neil Ernst. That’s true. But in your example I would say that this is what web frameworks are giving us—they are painful to set up, but on the whole worth it and an improvement over the status quo of a few years ago. However going from that to systems “generated automatically by algorithms based on well specified requirements and test cases” is a big qualitative jump, and that’s the one that makes me very sceptical.                                                     | How Writing Code is Like Making Steel                                                        | 2015/11/12 at 1:41 pm  |
| Neil Ernst                             | In reply to Jorge Aranda. I think we’re still in agreement. I just think the level of abstraction where the discernment is needed will be higher. It’s a familiar argument: we almost never hand-code assembly anymore. Why should we hand-code fairly repetitive Javascript to make a page do something a thousand others do?                                                                                                                                                                  | How Writing Code is Like Making Steel                                                        | 2015/10/29 at 8:56 am  |
| Jorge Aranda                       | This is the odd instance where we disagree completely. I don’t discount search-based software development, but I don’t see how it can lead to the qualitative jumps in discernment that are routinely needed in software work. Funnily, when I read the title of your post, I was expecting the steel making analogy to go elsewhere: something about hardening and tempering based on the interaction of the system and the rest of the world, and I was fully prepared to agree with *that* analogy  | How Writing Code is Like Making Steel                                                        | 2015/10/29 at 1:06 am  |
| juli1                              | Wow – super interesting point of view. I think this is definitively an optimist point of view. Two to three years ago, I would have made fun of you.

| juli1                              | There are some guidelines for using a library in the “Hacker’s Guide to Python” (very good book by the way). The general idea is: if the framework makes a ton of work for you and is well supported by a BigCo, go for it! If you are just using a function in a library, implement it yourself and avoid the headaches of compatibility and maintenance. Example: wanna make a dynamic mobile app? Use jquery – this is supported by Microsoft, google, etc … the big players of the web! So you have a good probability it will be maintained AND supportedExample 2: want to write excel documents in Java do not take jexcelapi (<http://jexcelapi.sourceforge.net/>), this is done by a single guy and the last version is 4 years old! Take Apache POI that is active and still under development (and supported by a foundation).My 2 cents: use common sense to architecture your software and weight pros/cons to rely on somebody else.                                                                                                                                                 | Frameworks, libraries, and dependencies                                                      | 2015/01/20 at 8:18 am  |

It’s been a while, so things may have changed, but if header levels don’t work you might want to try a bulk search and replace in the resulting Latex file (e.g. s/chapter/section/ & s/section/subsection.                         | Writing Complex Latex Documents with Scrivener 2.1 and MultiMarkDown 3 | 2014/09/24 at 7:45 am  |

| Neil                               | I think it is probably a challenge on every project, agile or not – certainly that is what we hear from various clients we have at SEI.

Do you have any information why (2-5) should be easier to make visible in non-agile projects? Just curious. For example, on the one hand I assume that (3) could be difficult, because you would not implement for future technical challenges (YAGNI). On the other hand, plan for change enables organizations to move quickly, when a new opportunity arises.

| Arber Borici (@ArberBorix)         | Thanks for pointing it out. This is particularly true for two other classes of problems PhD researchers encounter: undecidable and hard. I’m often puzzled to hear of PhD students trying to come up with solutions to problems which the Halting problem is reducible to. Also, instead of spending a few hours thinking whether another problem is hard or not, they immediately jump into finding a solution. Which turns out to be frustrating after a few months of failed attempts :)…    | A stitch in time…                                                                            | 2013/01/06 at 2:33 pm  |

Are you aware of our JazzHub offering (hub.jazz.net)? JazzHub removes the requirement for a locally installed server and allows the students to quickly setup projects in the cloud. I’d love to talk to you about it and show you a demo. Also, you will be happy to know that one of the new features we added in RTC 4.0 is windows shell integration. This would allow your students to use whatever IDE they want — with no RTC integration required. Then they could use windows explorer to sync their files, much like you describe with Git above. Here is a blog discussing that feature: <https://jazz.net/blog/index.php/2012/02/06/introducing-the-rational-team-concert-shell-integration-for-windows-explorer/>I’d also be very curious to hear more of the comments you get on your course feedback — as those are exactly the types of things we need to know.–Dan                                                    | Using GitHub for 3rd Year Software Engineering                                               | 2012/08/13 at 1:05 pm  |

| planetpolly                        | Our software team transitioned about a year ago from SVN to Git / Github. Thinking about it from a teaching perspective, I would way rather have a separate version control tool, outside the IDE, to start with – it makes it clear what the tool is doing, and then when a student is later shown IDE integration, they ‘get’ that is is making their lives easier, but they better understand the underlying mechanism. Otherwise it’s easy to memorize the ‘steps’ to get code checked in without really understanding the underlying version control model…Do you have any info on the industry adoption of these tools? Teaching students how to use git and the underlying models seems like a valuable skill.

But for most of the questions we’re interested in, there’s already plenty of theories (sociological, psychological, organizational) that, with slight modifications, should be applicable in our field.

| Stephan Lewandowsky                | righto, thanks, that clarifies it. so i presume the \ref commands are likewise just embedded in the scrivener text so you can refer to figures and so on? final question: do you know if mmd3.2 for windows integrates equally seamlessly with scrivener?    | Writing Complex Latex Documents with Scrivener 2.1 and MultiMarkDown 3 | 2011/11/16 at 3:52 pm  |
| Neil                               | In reply to Stephan Lewandowsky. Yes, you type MMD syntax into Scrivener. E.g., [#ernst11re;]. Then the Scrivener “compile” menu choose MMD->Latex. You can make tables with MMD, but since a lot of my thesis was already in Latex, I would surround the Latex syntax for the figures and tables with HTML comments, which are then translated verbatim during the compile process. The compile command generates a .tex file, which you then must compile using pdflatex or what have you. I believe you can skip this and go straight from MMD to PDF, but I need more customization.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Writing Complex Latex Documents with Scrivener 2.1 and MultiMarkDown 3 | 2011/11/16 at 9:17 am  |
| Paul Gvildys                       | In reply to Neil. The code is similar enough for the most part (I’m on enough maintenance release code reviews that this holds true for the most part).The difficult thing is not just the switching, it’s the “being pulled away from mainline dev” and so having a hard time getting the mainline dev stuff done. There’s also the case where some maintenance is so old that it runs on different platforms, resulting in having several Virtualized OSes lying about.                        | My new gig at UBC                                                                            | 2011/11/16 at 7:58 am  |
| Stephan Lewandowsky                | Very nice post, very helpful and succinct. What I cannot figure out is what you actually type into scrivener to get the commands into MMD and ultimately LaTex. That is, the [#Jarke..] and [^foot1] commands in your mmd file; are they typed into Scrivener exactly like that? And how do you insert figures and tables with references to it. I noted that your sample .tex file contained a \figure with a \label: How does this start out in scrivener? I am also unclear on what the final output of the scrivener compile command is: Is it a LaTeX file which you then need to process via standard LaTeX compilation or is it a complete PDF (which means scrivener somehow pulls in miktex or whatever to do the job).                                                                      | Writing Complex Latex Documents with Scrivener 2.1 and MultiMarkDown 3| 2011/11/16 at 2:55 am  |

| David                              | The key challenge for LSCITS and ULS style initatives is to develop a science and engineering of software systems that enables the prediction, identification, management and troubleshooting of emergent behaviour. The fundamental problem is that current software engineering techniques do not tend to cope well with emergence. In otherwords we are not as good as industry would like us to be at the predicting and coping with non-linear interactions. Example problem 1: When ‘Company A’ scales up a distributed system from 10,000 to 100,000 nodes and it behaves in ways that their state-of-the-art models and simulations did not predict. Example problem 2: When ‘Company B’ deployed a system at their Manchester office the users benefited from its functionality and it worked as expected. However when ‘Company B’ deployed the same system at several of other sites it was resisted and workers claimed that it did not fit the way their sites worked despite them having the same business processes as at Manchester.                                               | Ultra-large-scale systems: fundamentally different?                                          | 2011/11/15 at 11:37 am |

| Fabiano                            | In reply to Neil. The challenge is not in size. I guess the fundamental difference is in real agent-orientation. What that means is that every agent is a locus of control, you don’t have a (hierarchical) centralized control and what actually matters is interaction among these “agents”. Therefore, traditional algorithms/design methodologies result conceptually inadequate.                                                                                                           | Ultra-large-scale systems: fundamentally different?                                          | 2011/10/11 at 4:53 am  |

| Neil                               | In reply to Jorge Aranda. I don’t agree that this increasing complexity is anything *fundamentally* new. Arguably, someone from the 80s would be incredibly surprised at the complexity of software today – e.g., a fly-by-wire system in an airplane, even a portable phone that can direct me to the nearest Starbucks. I’m a software optimist: I think by and large software has dealt with some enormously challenging systems very capably.                                               | Ultra-large-scale systems: fundamentally different?                                          | 2011/09/30 at 5:52 pm  |
| Jorge Aranda                       | I think the issue is not so much that these systems are “ultra” large (whatever “ultra” means), but that they are increasingly complex, and systems change in their behaviour and understandability with complexity. So—the argument goes—it’s not that we’re dealing with instructions that are orders of magnitude more numerous, but that they are supposed to serve a function in sociotechnical systems that are orders of magnitude more complex.                                         | Ultra-large-scale systems: fundamentally different?                                          | 2011/09/30 at 4:36 pm  |

| Neil                               | In reply to Patrik Björklund. I’m not as familiar with the business side of things, but there is good research from Scandinavia on business requirements, software development, and maintenance. For example, Bente Anda’s paper on four companies building the same system. In general studying these things is challenging because of the complexity. Controlling for all the variables is essentially impossible. So most of the research is case study format, and its poorer cousin, anecdote. I too find it strange though that so much empirical software research was done in the 80s and then died out. Perhaps the lesson is that the research didn’t generalize very well to other settings (e.g., the Basili studies on NASA are a pretty unique environment).                           | IT failure statistics                                                                        | 2011/01/29 at 11:15 pm |

| Neil                               | In reply to microbe. My supervisor makes comments on the PDF I create, and I then fix things up in the Scrivener file. That way I can save a “snapshot” of my work prior to making his changes. So the Scrivener version is always canonical. I would say to pick one version and make it the main one, otherwise you’re right, it’s a nightmare. If your supervisor makes changes in Latex (lucky!) I’d just use version control (e.g., Git) and stick with Latex. For safety I have my latex export in a Dropbox folder, and save Scrivener backups (zip files) to the same folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Some notes on integrating Mendeley, Scrivener, MultiMarkdown and (Xe)Latex                   | 2011/01/28 at 10:40 am |

But let’s not get into the debate again right here… Being ‘from the industry’, I agree with your observation that the quality of the end-product should be the focus, and that the academia must be aware of this.

I agree wholeheartedly that our planet needs attention but what I am saying is that chasing after the life giving gas CO2 as the culprit, will simply divert resources away from the real problems that need attention such as heavy metal pollution, genuinely poisonous gases and chemical waste etc. AND if the IPPCC have their way, meeting the carbon emission targets and the proposed transfers to third world countries they propose will simply break the world economy. In the pipeline for my blog is a page that will show how the proposed targets if implimented will cause general economic collapse and likely starvation for you, me and our children.

| Cameron Neylon                     | I think its a really interesting question what the threshold is for different purposes. I mean that there is no reason not to record everything, because it is “easy” and comprehensive. But when you’re presenting that for some specific person or system for a specific purpose you will want to summarize it in some way. The choices you make seem to me to depend on what the purpose of your communication is and what/who the target is. Trivial example, if you want to show to a software developer a problem with their system you want a different kind of summary than the cleaned up and streamlined version that you might submit with a paper. But there are a lots of subtleties here. What do you think about the ideas I suggested about capturing the relationships between the objects you created? Does that work in your context or is there too much command line work between the creation of the relevant objects?| A better scientific notebook                                                                 | 2010/01/16 at 6:17 am  |

| Rui Curado                         | You may want to keep an eye on ABSE (<http://www.abse.info>). ABSE is a code-generation and model-driven software development methodology that is completely agnostic in terms of platform and language, so you wouldn’t have any trouble applying CBSE or any other approach you would like. The big plus is that you can generate code exactly the way you want. The downside is that you may have more work to do at first to build your templates. But this is a common scenario in all model-based approaches. After all, it’s “model-driven”, so you’ll have to build the models! ABSE allows you to capture your domain knowledge into “Atoms”, which are basically fragments of larger models you can build. ABSE is both declarative and executable. The model is able to generate code by your specification and incorporate custom code at the model level.Unfortunately, ABSE is still work in progress and an Integrated Development Environment (named AtomWeaver) is still in the making. Anyway a CTP release of the generator is scheduled for Jan-Feb 2010, so we’re already close to it.| My experience with model-driven development                                                  | 2010/01/01 at 7:22 am  |

| Anonymous                          | Knuth’s Art of Computer Volume 4 on Combinatorics, Permutations and Combinations would give you the answer.As long as you are allowed to check each subset once and in order you can do this with the storage limit of a single job. How? Iterate through all combinations, one at a time, and then operate on each of those subsets. So as long as all you need to do is iterate and test, you’re good, you don’t need crazy memory.

| Neil                               | In reply to Jon P. S is a set in P, I should fix that. The trouble is that f(1) = True and f(2) = True does not imply F([1,2]) = True. What I’m dealing with are requirements, so P is a powerset of requirements, and requirements might interact, e.g., requirement 1 makes it impossible to achieve requirement 2. We want to maximize the set of requirements we can achieve (where f() tells us if we can achieve that set). So we just remove subsets of it without knowing or caring what their individual results are. thanks for the comment!| My sample Google/Microsoft interview question                                                | 2009/11/14 at 1:23 pm  |
| Jon P                              | Hey Neil, I probably don’t understand the problem exactly because the following solution seems trivial. First off, I assume that f takes an element of P (the powerset)… that is, f takes a set. In your post you say it takes a subset, but that would mean f takes a set of sets, no? I assume not. Anyhow, if f returns true on set S then you say the we must remove all of the elements in the power set of S from P. Presumably f also returns true for all the elements of the powerset of S if it returns true for S. If so, then it returns true for each of the original set items (the ones that which P is the powerset of) that appear in any S which f(S) returns true on. So solution: just run f on every element in the original set of items and filter out the powerset of the set of items for which f returns true. E.g. if f returns true for f(1), f(3), and f(5), subtract powerset([1,3,5]) from P and you’re done. What am I missing?| My sample Google/Microsoft interview question                                                | 2009/11/14 at 12:37 pm |

| Aran Donohue                       | I don’t think it is a fair comparison. Your examples of large enterprisey things are designed in a certain way for good reasons. J2EE is big because it needs to satisfy every use case. They ask, “What technologies do we need to solve all these problems?” The agile world comes from the opposite direction. They ask, “What problems can we solve with these elegant, simple technologies?” Then they develop new simple technologies that fit nicely on that curve. As for processes, I think that canned processes have limited utility when applied to large projects. Agile needs you to have a “customer”who runs acceptance tests. A large project has dozens of different customer types. All the iterative processes fundamentally rely on short iterations. This becomes nonsensical when individual “features” are way larger than any reasonable iteration speed. As for a PhD to establish the benefits of the agile world, I think a better question would be to ask, “How do all these (smart) people NOT using these modern fancy tools manage to succeed nonetheless?”| Are we missing something?                                                                    | 2009/07/06 at 9:01 pm  |

The question becomes what should my organization do, given its particular context, and this is still a very open research question.

| Sam                                | Here in Manchester (UK) there are rather a lot of similar schemes to the one you mention in Toronto with cycle-strips down the side of a number of major roads in and out of the city. And it’s infuriating. There are the parked cars (which I was shocked to discover is actually _legal_ according to local byelaws), the strips stop and start randomly at very short intervals, and worst of all much of the time the cycle provision is to share a lane with busses and taxis. Being cut up by irate bus drivers is insanely dangerous and I’ve had a number of hairy moments trying to get past on both the inside and the outside. By contrast, a recent trip to Paris revealed (for the most part) a much better engineered city, curb-separated lanes and a clear sense of priority for bikes. Your idea of dedicating a thoroughfare for cycle transit and Steve’s tales of Montreal’s bi-directional separated lanes sound like even better solutions yet. I always berate other cyclists who jump lights they are such fools.| Pointless: Bike lanes downtown                                                               | 2009/06/25 at 10:03 am |

| Chris Siebenmann                   | The story I’ve heard about Toronto-style bike lanes is that their real advantage (and possibly their real purpose) is that they encourage more people to go out and bike because they make those people feel safer.

| Steve Easterbrook                  | I completely agree. Toronto’s bike lanes are mostly useless. The only sensible way to do this is build bike paths that motor vehicles cannot drive or park on. Eg separated from the vehicular traffic by a raised curb. I noticed some of this in Montreal – they’ve taken a whole vehicle lane, built a curb to separate it, and put a bi-directional bike path in it.

| Abram                              | My problem with GIT is that the model is dirty and unclear. GIT is real deal software and it relies on an underlying model, but when I think I’ve learned the model I find I haven’t. Or the maintainers have not given me an interface to do so. Here’s one example. I checked out an older version of a repo and I commited. Where does that commit go? Turns out it was on an non-existent branch, so I couldn’t check it out without the exact commit ID, I couldn’t do anything with it. It was effectively lost. So then I tried to apply my knowledge of GIT, first I searched for commands which would let me query the children of a commit. Nope. Then I searched for commands which let me search for nodes with a certain parent. Nope. Eventually I found git-lost-found and recovered it. I didn’t have this problem in DARCS <http://darcs.net/manual/node9.html> Which was built ground up on a formal model of patching. Surprisingly the creator is not some formal models/methods buff, but a physicist. I don’t use darcs much anymore because it is rather slow.| Two minor thoughts                                                                           | 2009/02/16 at 3:37 pm  |
| August                             | I believe the subjunctive mood in English is still alive and kicking. It just seems dead because our verbs don’t have a lot of different endings like other languages. Except for the verb “to be,” the subjunctive is mostly undetectable in English. Only in the 3rd person singular (he/she/it) can you see it at work. Indicative: He GOES to a meeting. Subjunctive: I insisted he GO to a meeting. If I turned it around and said, He insisted I GO to a meeting, that would still be subjunctive, but it would be undetectable, no different from the indicative, I GO to a meeting. The verb “to be” tells the real tale, because the subjunctive verb form is “BE” for all persons and that doesn’t coincide with any of the indicative verb forms. Indicative: I AM here. You ARE here. She IS here. We (or they) ARE here. Subjunctive: He insisted I BE here. Or: They insisted we BE here, etc. Then there is always, “If I WERE a rich man.” “If she WERE a mermaid.” But again, you can’t hear a difference with “you, we, or they,” because they use WERE in either case. So, English speakers DO STILL use the subjunctive. It’s just hard to tell when we’re doing most of the time.| The subjunctive case and intentionality                                                      | 2009/02/12 at 10:52 pm |

There are companies that deal with very complex projects and yet shun the systematic use of UML. Microsoft is one of them. In a paper I discussed recently, Cherubini said that in his discussions with Microsoft engineers, he found that “most of the diagrams had a transient nature because of the high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings.

| David Locke                        | Why are requirements non-deterministic? The non-determinism originates in the fact that the inputs change and that there is rarely a single source for those inputs. Given the elicitors role in asserting the elicitor’s own needs over those of the requirements source, the problem starts there. Change the elicitor, change the requirements. Then, you have the efficency focus of requirements elicitation process, which says get all the requirements sources into a room and have them decide what the requirements will be, which in turn means sacrificing requirements to utility functions, and washing away the cultural differences of the users, so the requirements can be efficently developed. This later issue injects politics and sociology into the elicitation process, thus so much for science, and hurah for requirements volitility. The software world has and continues to ignore culture, aka meaning, in the systems it develops. Silo busing, integration, and real-time data warehouses is just making it worse. Developers are much less expensive now, so lets put an end to efficent development as a goal, and let’s put a stop to generic software that fits no particular user and drives up those negative-use costs that accountants don’t account for, but every CFO feels. If you elicit requirements from one person, they stop being non-deterministic, they make that person efficent, and they are much less volatile. The elicitation process is not to blame for the non-determinism. By way of a practical application, say we are developing a cost accounting system. Which will it ultimately be: traditional, activity-based, or throughput? Throughput being the most recent, it has the least amount of adoption by older accountants, more by the fresh out of school accountants, and the least amount of adoption by management, aka the utility function. So it won’t be throughput, unless the management has a vocal early adopter amoung it. Activity-based will probably win, because it is the majority paradigm today. Traditional will probably lose, because it is basically fostered by the older accountants waiting for the age-based layoff, or retirement. Still, all three will be elicited. Then, they will be fought about with the utility function winning the day, expertise being ignored, and knowledge being destroyed. Once the development of those requirements are commissioned, the requirements politics will continue to churn the requirements. The end result will be a mess, which will require participants from all three paradigms to build Excel spreadsheets to compensate for what the system won’t do–time wasted invisibly, except on the actual, non-accounting, bottom line, the negative use costs. This more than determinism is the real problem with the requirements elicitation process.| Repeatability in requirements elicitation                                                    | 2007/03/13 at 9:25 am  |
| Jorge                              | It is definitely a great movie; I’m glad you liked it too! The translation indeed would be “The Labyrinth of the Faun”. The faun, which I believe in this case stands for “male fairy”, would be the character Pan, not the deity. Also, in Spanish “pan” means bread, so “El Laberinto de Pan” would have a very bizarre meaning for us –The Labyrinth of Bread. As for whether the Spanish Civil War resonates with Mexicans: during the war, many Spaniards escaped to Mexico, and were generally prosperous there. So among many middle- and high-class circles in Mexico, the Spanish Civil War felt close and is still relevant. I assume Guillermo del Toro, the director, was raised in this environment: he has one other movie set in the same period, The Devil’s Backbone. In general, Mexico has a complex relationship with Spain: To put it simply, Mexicans see Spain both as our “cultural mother” and “the thief who took away all our gold and destroyed our native civilizations” (everyone’s views are more elaborate than that, of course, but that gives you an idea).I’d also recommend another recent movie by a Mexican director: Children of Men.

Beyond a certain point, I would assume that agile approaches are too unstructured, too unpredictable and too unorganized. Regarding your pole analogy (which I liked very much).

This is especially true in the multi-disciplinary era we seem to be in. My other, more cynical observation would be that your second reason is equally applicable to conference proceedings! Perhaps to a lesser degree, though.| The role of arXiv in information science research                                            | 2006/11/16 at 3:26 pm  |
| Jorge                              | Interesting post, Neil. I think the first problem you talk about (just how useful is this paper?) is more important than it seems, for two reasons. First, even considering only peer-reviewed work, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of relevant papers produced every year, in any field. Just keeping on top of these involves a great deal of time. Without that initial filter that is peer review, we’d have four or five times as many papers to consider. The second reason is that we often can’t determine the usefulness of a paper until after we’ve read a considerable fragment of it. For example, a paper might seem helpful until when, halfway through, you spot a glaring methodological mistake that makes the paper completely unreliable. It’s unrealistic to perform this careful, critical thought on every technical report or paper that hasn’t passed the peer review test. On the other hand, it’s still a worthy initiative, especially if you’re only browsing for very specific topics –peer reviewed publications are terribly slow, and something like arXiv could speed things up quite a bit.| The role of arXiv in information science research                                            | 2006/11/16 at 3:10 pm  |

| Jorge                              | Agreed, Neil. I’m pretty convinced that software cannot (perhaps *should not*) be engineered, at least not in the way we understand engineering to be.

| Yaroslav Bulatov                   | People haven’t proved that there isn’t a killer algorithm for learning to predict relevant websites, but there’s something related, the No Free Lunch theorems, <http://www.no-free-lunch.org/>Basically an algorithm that works exceptionally well in one area, is bound to be exceptionally bad in another area. This implies that a good algorithm for google would have to be hand-taylored to it’s prediction task, and that we would have to hand-code a lot of the knowledge that it’s trying to extract from the data, into the algorithm itself. An interesting application of “no free lunch” philosophy is the idea of anti-learning. Instead of designing an algorithm to perform well on realistic data, we can design an algorithm to perform badly on random data, to the same effect.,| Peter Norvig talks at UofT                                                                   | 2005/11/23 at 2:53 pm  |
| Stephen Fickas                     | You note the following question: Big question: is the RE goal achievable? I.e. can a sufficiently detailed analysis actually produce something perfectly in line with user expectations? Almost certainly not. This is why, I conjecture, CWA type analysis is needed, since it provides a domain model (as RIck is suggesting) that the user can use at the KBB level, to deal with unanticipated/unexpected events. If no, perhaps just use a small goal model and define a tight system boundary. We’ve started to run up against this question. Might want to look at my RE05 paper off <http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/~fickas>. I think the notion of a “goal attainment scale” is interesting.

| Piotr Kaminski                     | First, a quibble: Reef is all about integrating code and UML *with* programmer interference. Automated RE systems are a failure except for very specific scenarios. However, Reef also treats developer attention as a precious resource, and tries to leverage their effort far more than other tools I’ve seen. The very simple difference between Reef and MDA is that in MDA, the model must be a *complete* representation of the system and therefore bears the full complexity of the implementation. In Reef, the model is an *abstracted* representation of the system, with designer-selected details elided to enhance high-level understandability without affecting the implementation. MDA seems to be based on the belief that, with sufficiently powerful transformation facilities, a model can be *both* abstracted and complete; I think this is not achievable in the short term, and in the long term is essentially equivalent to a new higher-level programming language. Which would certainly be a good thing, but history tells us that 1) it’s not likely to be graphical and 2) it is not wise to let every fool invent his own language (as MDA seems to encourage).                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Trac and me                                                                                  | 2005/09/11 at 1:32 am  |

| Neil   | In reply to Alexy Khrabrov. If you use Scrivener and MMD export, anything between is passed directly through as Latex. So for complex tables or math I prefer this approach to the MMD footnotes and Unicode math symbols. e.g.  *&lt;!-- \begin{table}[h] \caption{Harker's types of requirements change (after \cite{harker93})} \centering \label{tbl:harker} \begin{tabular}{ccc} --&gt;*  will be skipped in the output conversion (since it is converted to XHTML), the comments removed, then parsed by Latex as a table.
