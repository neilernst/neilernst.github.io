excerpt: 'UPDATE: changed the title of this page from "the world is .." as this is
  also the title of a popular poem by Wordsworth.  My silly update on personal life
  ranked 12th overall for this title!  Bad google.


  Seems like everyone is working hard on the thesis.  Funny, it seems like there is
  a real clump of students about to leave. <!--break--> Jeff and Xiaomin will defend
  in a month, Polly and Victor in 2 or so, Dave, Lu, myself in 3  months.  The lab
  would be empty were it not for new students arriving (Liz, Ian, Anthony, Del, Jie).  We
  should get the new people up and running soon, as they will have to start taking
  over the more mundane tasks - web pages, meetings, etc.  It''s interesting to watch
  these guys coming up to speed and realize that was me over 2 years ago!  Shocking.


  On my personal thesis front, I have spent the last 3-4 days getting my LaTex system
  up and running.  I now have it to the point where I can just type away and not worry
  whether it will work.  I imagine I will have to do a little more work in the end,
  some layouts etc. are not working right, but for now, I have a system figgered to
  handle citations and lists, so I''m off to the races. ;)  I get such a buzz from
  writing, it''s so much fun (a good sign, but I''m sure I will have the low points
  coming soon :jawdrop:).  The music goes on, the foot starts tapping, and my fingers
  are flying!  Not sure why I''m so hyper today actually.  I need to leverage my stoke
  so I can get a lot done while my mania is still strong.


  Oh yeah, last teaching day today, too.  Nice.'
