title: Evaluation in software engineering
---

How does one evaluate a software project?  Here's one way of building a software program: ask users what they want from their tool.  Build a tool with those features.  Ask them how it is.  Presumably they say it meets their needs.  What has been demonstrated?  Nothing, I'd argue, apart from one's engineering expertise.

Here's another approach: theorize about what tools in this particular domain require (for example, visualization of knowledge models).  Implement a tool which seems to fulfill this criteria (or part of this criteria).  Ask a group of domain users (difficult sometimes) how it improves their task completion abilities.  If it does so in a statistically significant way (ie. 19 times out of 20, it is the case that your tool is an improvement due to its features, not merely a random effect), then one can conclude that the null hypothesis can be rejected with some confidence (H0 being that users are better off with the usual tool).
