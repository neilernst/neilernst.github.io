title: Whither the Semantic Web?
---

A lot of people pooh-pooh the idea of a [Semantic Web](http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/).  Which is fair, to be honest, because pipe-dreams come and go, and only a few stick  around for the long-haul.  HTML, for example, came out of relative obscurity to international prominence, all without a global push and many articles telling people how great it would be.  
  
My position on it is that the specifics of the SW may never exist as they are stated today -- complete with OWL, RDF, and URIs.  But at some point, we as a society (Western, global, what have you) will need and desire to operate on a higher level than the syntactical one we use now.  And poof!  that will be the Semantic Web.  I definitely see it as an emergent, bottom-up process.  The W3C helps this, I think, by just proposing simple plumbing suggestions (like RDF).
