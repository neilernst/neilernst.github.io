title: Weekend update
---

Saturday involved a lot of rowing in the morning (need video to see what I'm doing), followed by a lengthy boathouse cleanup for the afternoon. I cleaned the single and stripped it down to the hull and then re-assembled it.  Al that's left to do is to add in the wax finish and it will be amazing.  Well, still slow as sh*t but nice looking.

I just finished editing the Softvis paper by Jeff, Rob, and Xiaomin, which looks very good.  It is a detailed description of what was done to integrate Shrimp with Eclipse.  I think with Eclipse we have a very useful IDE with a large userbase; this helps to eliminate some of the problems with ACSE.  I'm playing with Ruby, a slick OO language that seems interesting.  I'm also looking at the taxonomy support in Drupal and trying to integrate the RDF format with it.
