title: The return
---

Back in Vic after a marathon 36 hour voyage home, via Chicago and Vancouver, overnighting in the Delta hotel in Van after I missed the connection. This week I am typing up the notes I had from the observations (2.4 hours of tape, numerous scribbles), finishing off the ACSE paper, and attempting to install Drupal. Today I gave it a good go, but it still runs into problems. The tables build fine in Postgres, so that isn't the trouble, but some sort of PHP problem. I really want it to work but if I can't get any lovin' I may have to resort to MovableType. I must increase my work on Shrimp-bib as that has slipped (although the Drupal stuff is related..)
