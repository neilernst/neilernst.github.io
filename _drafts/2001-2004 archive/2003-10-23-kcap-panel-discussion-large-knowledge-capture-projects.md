Nigel Shadbolt: [AKT](http://www.aktors.org/akt/)  

Started Sept 00 with 65 investigators.
_Infosmog_: information overload => getting right information to right people is the focus.  Can't deal with knowledge on the web unless you focus on all aspects of the life cycle.  A large, multi-university project with core focuses in different areas.  First 3 years spent building infrastructure.  The six year lifespan is really beneficial for building well-developed tools.
