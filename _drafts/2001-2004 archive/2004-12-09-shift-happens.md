title: Shift happens
---

To borrow from a column in the G&M today...

In a week I'll head back to Victoria and the West coast for Christmas.  In some ways this is like visiting my old life.  When I left for Ontario July 27th, nearly 5 months ago, I *knew* a change was happening, that the course of my life was shifting headings. However, only now am I starting to appreciate just how big a change this has been.

In July I lived without a fiancee in a basement room at my parents' house, doing little, having just finished a long Master's degree.  I was training for a marathon, reading books, and basically hanging out (meanwhile my fiancee was busting her hump out East organizing things, but anyway :-).
