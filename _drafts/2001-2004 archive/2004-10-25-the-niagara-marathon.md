title: The Niagara Marathon

This past Sunday I ran in the [Niagara Marathon](http://niagarafallsmarathon.com), which goes from downtown Buffalo, NY, to the famous Falls, via Fort Erie and the Peace Bridge.  My time for the distance was 3:38 and change, and the process of getting there was challenging.

I started training for the run in June when I decided that since I wasn't rowing anymore, I ought to try something else.  I set my sights on an October marathon (typically, training phases last 4 months) out in Ontario.  I joined the [Running Room](http://www.runningroom.com), which, for 70 dollars, offers a 12 week clinic on marathons (as well as other distances).  The advantage was that I would be surrounded by other people of like mind, as well as knowledgeable instructors. :smile:
