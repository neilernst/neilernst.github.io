title: Kids Help Phone presentation

A group of researchers in the KM group gave a run-through of their work on a project designed to do requirements modeling for a children's charity.  The project involved questionnaire+interviews of fourteen stakeholders, from which one group of modellers synthesized the results and then created a global model, and another group created a model for each stakeholder, and then attempted to merge the models.  The work sounded a lot like knowledge elicitation work, and ontology design.  I'm not clear to what extent this overlaps yet.  A number of good questions were raised concerning how the interview structure may have predetermined certain answers and biases.  However, the given context of work precluded more ethnographic approaches (confidentiality and privacy issues).
