title: Shrimp-bib project
---

Met with Polly today to talk about the Shrimp-bib project. Our first step will be to investigate how to use Protege to do the things we want. A central question is, How do end-users access the instances (without modifying the underlying schema i.e not allowing them to add new classes, only instances). Polly is going to examine how we can distribute a Protege-based project, and I will look into importing multiple schemas and different instance files (for example, each person may have a FOAF file and one FOAF schema, how does Protege handle this one to many schema mapping?). I will also check out the KA tab in Protege. Finally, we will both work on a version of shrimp-bib that demonstrates these properties using Protege forms. (enter the current system into Protege).
