title: 'Canada and the world: a statement'
---

I think it is time for the leadership of Canada to start to make some clear and strong decisions on what Canada's place is in the world.

We want to be able to travel from place to place in this world proud to be Canadian.  We want to be able to stand up and, in Trudeau's words, say "This is who we are!"  We want to have a clear policy on world affairs.  We don't want to be defined by our increasingly unilateral neighbours to the South.

Our policy towards America should be one of limited engagement.  We should embrace the things America does well, and there is much to embrace, not least of which is Americans themselves.  We should embrace their individualism and tolerance, their leadership in preserving freedom.
